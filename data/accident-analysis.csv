south-fork-tuolumne,South Fork Tuolumne,"Two canyoneers attempted a first descent of the South Fork of the Tuolumne River, a narrow slot canyon with long waterfall drops. Slick granite and small working ledges complicated the journey. The canyoneers did not have rope, lifejackets, or thermal protection. The lead jumped into a pool from the third drop and landed on a submerged boulder, breaking his femur. As they did not have fixed ropes, he was unable to retreat. His partner was able to retreat up the last drop they had both completed, and was spotted by another party while shouting for help. They were able to retreat and call search and rescue. The responders assessed the situation:  it was too tight for a helicopter, “river running less than 500 cfs but drops over 500 feet per mile… freight train forces.” The partner canyoneer was experiencing symptoms of hypothermia. The lead canyoneer feared to be dead. Consequently the responders placed bolts and sent the most experienced team member to rappel aside the waterfall. He was able to make contact with the lead canyoneer who had sheltered in a protected place. The other responders were able to haul the first responder and canyoneer up the falls.",Main,"<ul><li>Pools can contain underwater hazards (bedrock feature, stick, boulder, siphon…) that are not visible from above.

pine-creek-1992-08-12,Pine Creek,"On the afternoon of August 12, 1992, four young Utah men attempted to descend into Pine Creek Canyon utilizing nothing more than a rope purchased from a hardware store. Because of the sheerness of the rock face and the numerous pour-offs, full-length climbing ropes, harnesses, other climbing equipment, and expertise on their uses are required for this descent. Despite their lack in these areas, the group descended to the first pour-off, and left a portion of their rope behind―presumably by cutting it. At the second pour-off, three of the youths descended to the end, using the now-shortened rope, and then dropped into a plunge pool, and became trapped in a keeper. The fourth member realized that they were foolishly and literally “in over their heads,” and decided to not take the plunge, and was therefore able to climb up the ropes they left behind, and report that his companions were unable to get out of the keeper pool. Four rangers and a local climber responded. They rappelled to the trio, demonstrated ascending techniques, and belayed the youths up and out of the canyon. This operation lasted well after dark―the rescue operation was completed at 11:00 p.m.",Main,"Know your canyon beforehand, and carry enough rope and hardware to get through."
subway,The Subway,"In the upper end of the slot canyon portion of The Subway, David Bryant, age 32, died from internal injuries after taking a 30-foot fall. He was rappelling off a tree―using it as an anchor―and the tree happened to break loose from its roots. Two others from his group had already rappelled ahead of him off this same tree without incident; however, when Bryant started his descent, the tree and its roots gave way. A doctor who was hiking nearby started mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Bryant, and eventually fashioned a breathing tube out of a milk carton handle, and inserted it into his throat to help him breathe. Another hiker went for help. A few hours later, an Air Force helicopter crew wearing night vision goggles, and aided by moonlight, descended into the canyon, picked up Bryant, and flew him to the Saint George hospital―30 miles away―where he arrived six hours after the fall. Sadly, he died at the hospital, only 10 minutes after his arrival.",Main,Natural anchors need to be strong and backed up.
kolob-canyon-1993-07-15,Kolob Canyon,"It was midsummer―July 15, 1993―in Zion’s Kolob Canyon. Three men and five teenage Explorer Scouts from Salt Lake City started off on a multi-day adventure on one of Zion’s most spectacular, but most dangerous drainages. Despite being trained
and well-prepared, little did they know that this adventure would turn into an epic, tragic disaster.
Kolob Creek flows southeast towards the North Fork of the Virgin River through Kolob Canyon, and it is usually a trickle during the middle of summer (except after thunderstorms, of course, when it will certainly flash flood). However, there was little chance of flash flooding for this group, because the weather forecast for the surrounding area was sunny, sweltering, nearly 90 degrees, and with little chance of precipitation. In spite of the toasty summer conditions, cold water with temperatures in the 40s flows through Kolob Canyon most of the year, due to the creek being fed by Kolob Reservoir, which sits just a few miles above the canyoneers at 8,100 feet above sea level. In the summer, usually a small amount―less than five cubic feet per second―comes trickling down the deep, narrow slot, providing beauteous canyon conditions. However, canyoneers also need to be ready for technical waterfall rappels, cold water swims, and changing canyon conditions that require the natural abilities to make life-or-death adjustments quickly and on-the-fly.
The group of Explorers had a permit from Zion National Park, and they were prepared―they had acquired skills in camping, rappelling, climbing, and hiking in cold water. In addition, they were all wearing wetsuits to insulate their bodies from the cold-water temperatures. Twenty-eight-year-old David Fleisher, the group’s leader, was confident, because he had done Kolob Canyon on two previous occasions.
The three adult group leaders were promptly forced to consider their predicament after getting down to the bottom of the first rappel, because the typical ankle-deep flow was moving swiftly past their knees. That much water was not supposed to be coming down! When they picked up the permit, park officials had told Fleischer that the water level was safe. However, the flow that they were standing in seemed like it was excessively high. (Certainly, it was higher than Fleischer had experienced in his previous descent). On that day, the creek was actually roaring down Kolob Canyon at a flow of nearly 30 cfs, instead of the normal summer flow of 5 cfs. This much water does not sound like a lot, but it made movement very laborious and unsafe, and communication―even by yelling between the party members―was nearly impossible, because the roar of the water in the canyon was so deafening.
The group pressed on the best they could, hoping for a dry spot where they could regroup and re-assess the situation, because it had become obvious that they were in over their heads. They came to a short, eight-foot “nuisance rappel”―a term used in the canyoneering community when the drop is barely long or dangerous enough to warrant the use of a rope.
Fleischer, being the group’s leader, rappelled first to check out the pool below. As he landed in the whirlpool at the bottom of the rappel, the others atop could see that he was in serious trouble. Fleischer was being thrashed by the water coming down, making it difficult to disconnect the rope from his climbing harness. At the same time, his backpack strap had slipped up and around his neck, and it was strangulating him.
The second leader, 37-year-old Kim Ellis, instinctively jumped from the top of the eight-foot drop into the pool, and managed to free Fleischer from the entanglement; but as this occurred, Ellis slipped and hit his head. He went straight to the bottom of the whirlpool! Immediately, the third leader, 35-year-old Mark Brewer, naturally jumped in too, and he helped get Ellis out of the whirlpool. However, in spite of Ellis being underwater for less than two minutes, and after the two other men performed 30 minutes of CPR, Ellis did not revive.
Since retreating or climbing out was not an option in the narrow dungeon, the two remaining leaders were then unsure of what to do. The truth is, in situations like that, nature provides the only options―and in those narrow aqueous corridors, the only way out for the group was to follow the water down.
The two remaining leaders rigged a rope so that the five boys could get safely down to them, while avoiding the lethal waterfall and whirlpool. The first boy to come down was the 14-year-old son of Ellis. He, and the rest of the group, certainly were in a state of shock. The group gave him a few minutes to say goodbye to his dad, before having to press on. At that point, the seven survivors were in survival mode, and had little choice but to continue down canyon. They had to leave behind the lifeless body of Ellis, so they propped it up against a log that was out of the current in a semi-dry spot. The group moved on―continuing down two more drops that required rappelling. By the time they reached the fourth rappel (with eight more still to go in the next half-mile), they had been in the water for two hours, but had only made 150 feet of downstream progress. The anchor rigging, rope work, and rappelling in a watery canyon can be very time-consuming and exhausting―especially with a large group that has members with varied levels of skills. To make matters worse, the group progressively lost six of their eight backpacks along the way―some of them were tossed down and swept away, before those below could grab them in time. Those packs held all the provisions and several days of food for the group.
At the fourth rappel, Fleischer tested the depth and the force of the whirlpool below, by tossing one of the remaining packs down with a rope attached. The whirlpool below was so strong, that none of them could pull the backpack free from above. Fleischer decided to jump down to the far side of the pool, swim back to grab the pack, and pull it over to the other side of the pool, where the current was less intense. If the pack and the rappelling rope were set at a horizontal angle across the pool, he assumed that he could act as a safety anchor to help the boys get across the whirlpool to the far side, and thus avoid the waterfall. He jumped, and his plan worked―he managed to get the pack free and across the pool.
All was well as he was resting on the far side of the pool with the backpack under his arm, until suddenly the whirlpool’s violent current sucked the pack away from him. Instinctively, he lunged after it, and almost immediately, both he and the pack were sucked down into the whirlpool below the pounding waterfall. The group―paralyzed by being so close, yet so far away―stared down in horror for a while, hoping that Fleischer would resurface. Unfortunately, he did not.
Brewer was then the last remaining adult leader, and had to decide whether to leap in and try to find and save Fleischer while risking his own life, or to remain with the terrified boys. After a moment of extra shock, he told the boys that Fleischer was probably dead, and that they should come back away from the top of the falls. The only choice that the remaining group of six had, was to stay put and to hope for a rescue.
The air temperature in Kolob Canyon was cool, even though it was summer, because the canyon bottom seldom sees more than an hour of sunlight per day. The water temperature was frigid too―for even with wetsuits (which are membranous and keep the skin constantly wet), the boys shivered as air temperatures plunged to 40 degrees that night. To keep themselves occupied, the boys built a small ledge out of rocks, where they could take turns getting out of the cold water; and they huddled up and slept on top of each other to keep warm. With Ellis’ body 30 feet above them on a log, and Fleischer’s body 15 feet below them somewhere in the unmerciful whirlpool, the nightmarish scenario felt like a cruel death-trap in a prison of stone and water. With the one remaining backpack, the group rationed out a dozen bars, some oatmeal packets, fruit rollups, and raisins. For the next four nights and five days, they stayed alive―even managing to stay somewhat positive―by singing songs and praying aloud.
After the group had failed to show up after the third day, distraught family members called the park, and Search and Rescue teams were dispatched. The six survivors heard and saw helicopter search teams repeatedly flying overhead, but they were never spotted from above, because they were more than a thousand feet deep in a dark slot canyon. Despite the dampness, they somehow were able to light a smoky driftwood signal fire from the last of their matches; however, the smoke never rose high enough for searchers to even notice. The boys would look up and scream as loud as they could, but none of the searchers could hear them either.
Finally, on July 19, the fifth day of being in the canyon, the water level suddenly dropped around them. Soon after, search teams from Washington County and Zion National Park were finally able to get through the canyon, and look for the surviving six down through the bottom of the canyon. A rope dropped down next to the group, and they knew their prayers were answered, as rescuers rappelled down to them. Waiting helicopters shuttled the group and Ellis’ body back to Zion. Two of the boys had edema in their legs and feet―caused from wearing their tight wetsuits for so long, and had to be briefly hospitalized. Fleischer’s body was not found until 11 days later, when a searcher discovered it further down canyon. The names and ages of the teenage survivors are Shawn Ellis, age 14; Rick Larson, age 16; Josh Nay, age 16; Mike Perkins, age 17; and. Chris Stevens, age 15.
This terribly sad tragedy in Kolob Canyon was a landmark event. It actually forced changes in some of the operating policies and procedures in the park. After the families sued and each settled out of court―first for $750,000 from the Washington County Water Conservancy District (WCWCD), and then for another $1.5 million from the National Park Service―changes were implemented to hopefully prevent that kind of catastrophe from occurring again, even though no admission of liability from the two agencies was agreed upon, as a part of the settlement. The park looked into taking a more proactive, regulative, and preventive stance in issuing canyoneering permits, especially for the dangerous slot canyons, that dot the park. Better communication lines were set up between the water district and Zion, so that release schedules from the reservoir and the amount of water coming down Kolob Creek would be ascertained by all. In addition, a strict policy and warning―to not canyoneer through Kolob Canyon if the water flow was greater than 5 cfs―was also implemented.
Despite the “blame” mainly falling on the two agencies, this does not relieve individuals and groups from taking personal responsibility for their own safety. According to Ray O’Neil, Zion’s Plateau District Ranger, the biggest change that occurred, as a result of the lawsuit, was a larger emphasis on the need for visitors to take greater responsibility for their own safety. For example, in the Kolob tragedy, the group saw the higher flows in Kolob Creek, but chose to continue. O’Neil also stated, “An off-duty park employee was aware of the higher flows, but was not aware that the WCWCD expected him to pass the information on to the permit-issuing desk. Zion National Park settled the lawsuit, in order to avoid creating some sort of absolute liability, where any knowledge of any hazard by any employee would have to be passed on to all employees and to all visitors.” The reasoning is that absolute liability would make managing risk on public lands virtually impossible and impracticable for the agencies involved.
Ultimately, as a canyoneer, being properly prepared, equipped, and informed is paramount; and is the responsibility of each person who enters the park, walks its trails, hikes its remote back-country, and uses ropes or aid in any dangerous, technical areas.",Main,Better preparation of the leaders and participants; and wisdom to know when to not enter a canyon due to dangerous conditions.

carrabeanga-2000-06-11,Carrabeanga Canyon,"In June 2000, two experienced members of the Newcastle University Mountaineering Club, Mark Charles and Steve Rogers, died while descending Carrabeanga Canyon.

The following report is from a feature article published in the Good Weekend magazine the following year. The reporter retraced the trip with an experienced canyon guide. He also included extensive details based on statements other group members provided to police following the tragedy.

—

On a crisp day in June last year, nine members of a university outdoors club set off on a weekend canyoning trip. Two would never return. Here, Matthew Moore unravels a tangled tale of the small errors and miscalculations that led to tragedy.

Death in the wilderness:

Background: It took the seven survivors of last year’s canyoning disaster three days to walk out of the wilderness, three days in which they discussed the tragedy and decided they would never publicly talk about it. In the 16 months since, they’ve stuck with their decision not to explain how the leaders of their trip perished in the night, on a rope, out of sight, their bodies later found lying in a shallow pool of water on a rock ledge by police rescuers.

Earlier this year, the Coroner in the NSW town of Bathurst investigated and decided no inquest was needed, satisfied that Mark Charles’s and Steve Rogers’ deaths were an accident that would never be completely explained. Canyoning experts have remained mystified about the details of the accident, struggling to understand the news reports at the time that the two most experienced people on the trip had somehow got caught on the same rope where they’d apparently died of hypothermia.

Although the group has declined to talk to the media or outsiders, they did talk to the police. In seven sworn statements, the survivors told a harrowing story of how their weekend adventure slowly turned into tragedy. They detailed a succession of mistakes and miscalculations, in themselves all quite minor, which when added together cost two lives and nearly took several more.

These accounts have now been made available to the Good Weekend by the Bathurst Coroner. They’ve allowed us to retrace the trip through the Kanagra wilderness in the southern Blue Mountains to try to piece together what happened. With professional guide Lucas Trihey (who has 20 years canyoning experience) and fellow climber and NSW Fire Brigade rescue instructor Mick Holton, Good Weekend abseiled into the canyon to prepare this account. We went in winter, as the group had done, and at the same time of day. We completed our final abseil at night, as they had done, giving ourselves the best chance of understanding what happened a year earlier…

By the time they’d left Christina’s Pizzeria in the northern Sydney suburb of Thornleigh, the nine canyoners were already running late. They’d stopped there for dinner on Friday night after driving 150 kilometres from Newcastle. And they still had a long haul before a very early start in the morning. All were students and ex-students of Newcastle University, in their twenties and early thirties, who’d signed up for a trip run by the university’s mountaineering club. The advertisement for the trip in the club’s newsletter, Watson, said: “10 to 12 June, contact Mark, grade medium. To celebrate the Queen’s Birthday we thought we’d visit the delightful Kanangra Boyd National Park. Saturday and Sunday will be an overnight dry canyon with more abseils than you can poke a piton at. Monday will be a spot of caving in Tuglow for those still feeling OK … Abseiling experience and decent fitness required.”

Kanangra Boyd National Park is in the southern part of the Blue Mountains wilderness, well away from the more frequented bushland surrounding the bed-and-breakfast belt around Katoomba, to the north-east. The Kanangra terrain is steeper and more inaccessible than almost anywhere in NSW.

On the Monday before they set out, Mark Charles and his good friend and club president Steve Rogers, both 25, hosted a skills night so the group could bone up on their abseiling techniques. Both were passionate climbers classified by the club as having intermediate abseiling and canyoning levels which allowed them to lead the trip and borrow all the climbing equipment they figured they’d need.

They were a mixed group. Steve Ahern was rated an intermediate-level canyoner while the club secretary, Sarah Warner, was also reasonably experienced, with more than 20 canyoning trips under her belt. After bushwalking and canyoning for six years, Claire Doherty was a lot more experienced than the other four. Andrew Bish, at 32 the oldest member of the group, had done a few smaller canyons but never been in such rugged country before. Simon Baker, Dan Weekes and visiting American student Jim Ching-Jen Wang had little experience.

In the past decade, canyoning has become a boom sport in the Blue Mountains, with adventurers poring over topographic maps searching for isolated valleys that might be hiding another pristine sliver of wilderness. To get to that wilderness you need only basic climbing equipment, because you normally start at the top and go down. You do that by tying a strong nylon tape, often seatbelt webbing, around a tree, threading a long rope through it and throwing the ends over the cliff. When the group has abseiled down this doubled rope, the rope is pulled through the tape sling from the bottom and the sling is left behind – this is known as a retrievable abseil.

It was after midnight by the time the group’s two cars pulled off the dirt road that runs across the Kanangra plateau and drove into the Boyd River camping area. It was close to freezing and the place was deserted. Rather than set up camp, they simply spread their sleeping bags under the awning of a shed.

Saturday dawned fine. Mark Charles woke them early and began dividing equipment into nine piles, each with a helmet, whistle, two karabiners, a climbing harness and an abseiling device. There were 3 ropes, each more than 50 metres long. After breakfast, Sarah Warner and Andrew Bish drove the group a few kilometres back the way they’d come the night before, to the trip’s starting point. Before they could set off, however, one of the cars had to be driven to the Kanagra Walls car park (about nine kilometres away), where they would exit on Sunday afternoon. None of the group had done the canyon before and none knew how long it would take, although their guidebook warned: “An early start is needed to get down the steep bit before camping.”

Nine is a big group to take canyoning, and with the shortest day of the year less than a fortnight away Steve Ahern was starting to worry that 10:30 was too late to start. Still, the walking was easy on a good trail through open heathland and gnarled snowgums, reminders that temperatures routinely drop to zero and below. The easy walking stopped when the track gave out after less than an hour and Charles needed his map and compass to guide them through thick scrub on the ridge that leads north-east to Carra Beanga Brook. For the next three or four hours, they struggled towards the headwaters of the creek, stumbling over loose rocks that shifted underfoot. It was flatter going but not much faster in the creek itself, with big ferns and fallen trees making progress slow.

It was after two – perhaps closer to four – when the moist undergrowth finally gave way to a dry, rocky cliff top and the huge Kanangra wilderness burst into view. They were perched at the top of the canyon, and gazed east across 60 kilometres of green-treed valleys capped with sandstone cliffs. Looking down, the creek disappeared over a sheer drop into a moist confusion of moss and fern. This is the point where the canyon starts: once that first abseil is done, it’s very tough to turn back.

Given the hour and the group’s slow progress, Sarah Warner was apprehensive. “Right from the start, Mark had made us all aware that we should try to get down the falls before night so that we could camp at the bottom rather than on the falls,” she told police later. She raised her concerns with Claire Doherty. And then she asked Rogers if he’d done another Kanangra canyon called Danae, which drops a similar distance. “I assumed he knew how long it would take to complete the abseiling down the falls,” she said.

Rogers didn’t. Their guidebook said they had “about 10 abseils” to get to the bottom. In fact, there are 16 – they had no chance of reaching the bottom before dark. But they had to keep moving to have a chance of sticking to their ambitious schedule, which required them to get back to their cars by Sunday night in order to use their caving permits on Monday.

Looking down into Carra Beanga Canyon, they could see the waterfall was not one long, sheer drop but a series of steps – although the tree canopy kept hidden any hint of what these steps might look like. Their first abseil took them out of the sun and into the moist undergrowth. It was colder there and some stopped to put on warmer clothes. But not Mark Charles. He was busy establishing a routine, anxious to keep the group moving.

Charles was the first one down each abseil. Once at the bottom, he’d find a tree that would serve as an anchor point for the next abseil and tie a length of climbing tape around it. The first few descents were straightforward and the group made steady progress. But as the light began to fade around 5 pm, so did the enthusiasm. Beneath the trees, they discovered some sloping ledges where they might have stopped but Charles and Rogers were pushing on, looking for somewhere big enough and flat enough to make camp.

On his first overnight abseiling trip, Baker was starting to worry: “The further we descended down the falls, the ledges became smaller and smaller. I was becoming concerned with the fact that it was getting late and it seemed like there was nowhere to stop.”

As the last of the light went, Doherty told Warner they should stop. They were hungry, it was getting colder and several members of the group were getting dangerously tired. The short walks between abseils were getting steeper and some struggled to keep their footing on the slippery gravel where a fall could be fatal. Although it was cold and dark, the moon was rising and Charles encouraged them to push on. Those with head-torches turned them on before they began their last major descent for the night.

Andrew Bish was increasingly distressed in terrain he called “rugged and dangerous … We abseiled over two pitches in the dark and found ourselves on two very narrow, cold and wet ledges. ‘By this stage I was very cold, tired, hungry and wet. I had no idea where I was.”

Following in their footsteps, we land on the same narrow ledge, a sliver of cliff and earth perched above a 50-metre drop. It’s about five metres long and slopes down to the left towards the waterfall, about six metres away. It’s more than a metre wide in parts but it feels less because it also slopes downhill. There’s only one tree, perhaps 15 centimetres wide at the base, where wood-boring insects have made their home. Still, it’s the most secure thing around and we tie ourselves and our rucksacks to it to avoid slipping off. With a light breeze blowing waterfall spray over us, we put on waterproof pants and jackets.

A year earlier, Mark Charles stood here and quickly tied one end of a rope to that little tree and threw the rest of it out into the dark. With a little more time, and a little more light, he might have managed to climb around to a much bigger tree just 20 metres to his right, away from the waterfall. There, he would have found a bunch of climbing tapes tied around its trunk, evidence of the route taken by most previous canyoners. But he was rushing to get his group somewhere safe, too busy to put on his waterproof clothing before he threaded the rope through his abseiling device and headed off.

The first three metres take you to another ledge about the same size as the one above, but wetter. The edge of this ledge drops steeply, about 70 degrees, for five metres before it becomes sharply vertical. Carra Beanga is known as a dry canyon, where wetsuits are not required, but the route Charles selected becomes wetter soon after the vertical section starts (see diagram at left). With the wind blowing spray onto him, Charles was wet by the time he got to the shallow pool more than 50 metres down. “Off rope,” he called when he reached the flat ground. His head-torch showed his search for a campsite was over. Stretching around him was a huge ledge some 40 metres long and 20 metres deep, covered in boulders but with plenty of room to light a fire and space for a group twice their size to spend the night in relative luxury. He dropped his rucksack there.

Above, and out of his sight, the rest of the party arrived on the ledges, half of them squeezed onto the top where it was drier, the rest forced to find space on the lower ledge. On the top ledge, Rogers and Warner tied two ropes together to form a retrievable abseil, threaded them through the same tape on the little tree that anchored Charles’s single rope and threw them over the cliff. They couldn’t see Charles, but they heard him shout for the next abseiler to follow. By then, close to 7 pm, some of the group were no longer up to it.

On the lower ledge, Claire Doherty could see things were getting bad. “I noticed Jim Wang was lying in the foetal position … [he] was shivering like crazy. I started to worry he may be in the early stages of hypothermia.”

Cold, hungry and wet, with some close to exhausted, no-one was keen to follow Charles and abseil into the unknown. “I got the impression that Pebie [Steven Rogers’ nickname] was reluctant to go first because he asked around for volunteers,” said Doherty. But no-one did, so Rogers headed off.

As he disappeared over the ledge, Doherty remembers him issuing one final instruction: “Let down the single rope [that Charles had used] when I get down to the bottom.”

Rogers had no idea that a safe camping spot lay at the end of this abseil and he wanted the single rope to set up the next abseil. It was to prove a critical error. Rogers fed the rope through his abseil device and moved easily down the steep five metres to the lower ledge, where the cliff becomes vertical. The next bit is wet and slippery but still straightforward. Then there’s a sharp indent in the rock face. Here, as your feet lose contact with the rock face, your rucksack pulls you suddenly backwards, dragging your feet up to where your head should be if you’re not wearing a chest sling. Rogers wasn’t.

From 10 metres below, Mark Charles would have watched Rogers reach a wet rock ledge that marks the end of the long vertical section. It’s slippery but quite flat. When we abseil down, it’s where we first stop. From there, the final bit of the descent is still steep but it’s a slope you can scramble down. Above Rogers, Andrew Bish felt the double rope and found it unweighted. “It’s slack, it feels like he’s off,” he reported, suggesting Rogers was standing on the ledge. Suddenly, the rope went tight again.

Almost certainly this was the moment when Rogers got hurt. The autopsy report revealed he’d suffered a serious wound in the back of his head, just below the helmet, some time before he died. It’s possible this happened on the way down to the ledge, if he’d slipped and somehow swung into the cliff face. But this doesn’t explain why Bish felt the rope go suddenly slack. More likely is-that as Rogers stood on that ledge, a falling rock, unseen in the dark, hit him in the back of the head. He was probably struck as he was looking down towards Charles, attempting to clear the bunched-up ends of the double rope that were found with him on his ledge when morning came. After abseiling down the same pitch, and standing on the same ledge, one of Good Weekend’s guides, Mick Holton, says he’s “almost certain” Rogers was hit by a falling rock, a conclusion he reached after accidentally dislodging a large rock himself.

They knew none of this on the ledges above, waiting for Charles to make the call to abseil. When the rope went suddenly tight, it was impossible for others to abseil down it. They grew confused by the shouts from below and the rope that stayed taut. They became uneasy.

“We were calling out, asking if we could abseil or not. I could hear a voice, which was definitely Mark’s, but I couldn’t understand the sentence he was saying,” Steve Ahern said.

For half an hour they shouted, their words muddied into incomprehension by the waterfall and reverberations from the surrounding cliffs.

“Every time we called out, Mark responded, but I could not make out what was being said. I thought Mark sounded troubled,” said Ahern. Rogers had been on the double rope perhaps half an hour when his best chance of rescue disappeared. Confused by the shouting and anxious to help in some way, the group untied the single unweighted rope Charles had used for his descent. They threw it over as Steve Rogers had instructed, but not before pondering the wisdom of doing so.

“I think Sarah may have indicated that she thought it was a bad idea in case something happened and the rest of us needed a rope to get down,” Dan Weekes said.

She was right. But at the time, still early in the evening, they were expecting to follow on the double rope Rogers was using. They assumed the shouts from below were part of the preparations for another abseil. With the spare rope gone, they got increasingly edgy. There was no chance to abseil down to investigate, and no-one attempted another technique known as Prusiking to descend the double rope far enough to get a clear view of what was happening 30 metres below.

Steve Ahern stood waiting for clearance to use the double rope, shouting slowly and clearly: “Can … we … abseil?” No, was the only response they could distinguish. So they waited. Hours passed. About 10.30 pm, Ahern and Warner tried to pull up enough slack to abseil down, but the rope was too tight. On their sloping ledges, and with nowhere for them all to tie onto, organising a rescue was hardly an option. Stuck there, wet and cold, some were struggling to look after themselves. And some were angry. They put their efforts into staying warm.

“We discussed the fact that perhaps Pebie and Mark had decided to sit the night out and wait for daylight,” said Doherty. “We decided that was the only thing we could do … I thought the double rope was now tight because they had locked it off or something.” Their ledges were too small to stretch out and they tried not to sleep for fear of rolling off. But, cold and exhausted, they dozed though the night before dawn broke.

“We were expecting Mark or Steve to call out, but there was nothing. By 8am we got really worried,” said Simon Baker.

Bish leaned out from his ledge, hoping for a glimpse of either of the group’s two leaders. He saw nothing. He tried again, this time aided by a Prusik sling (loops of thin ropes) which he attached to the double rope. This allowed him to lean out far enough to see the first hint of trouble: “I could see a red backpack lying on the ground and half of the single rope lying between the pack, with some in the water.”

Leaving an uncoiled rope lying in the water was right out of character for experienced climbers like Charles and Rogers. Also using Prusik slings, that allow climbers to ascend and descend climbing ropes, Ahern then came down from the top ledge. He managed to climb down past the overhang where the double rope was pulled tight against the rock. Leaning out, he saw the two men about 30 metres below, both upside down and attached to the rope. Rogers was still wearing his rucksack. Ahern headed back up to the ledge and turned to Warner.

“I could see from his face that something was wrong,” she said. “He was quiet for a while and he said, ‘They are tangled together.'”

No-one can know for sure what happened down below. But it’s certain that Charles died attempting to rescue his mate. He climbed up to the ledge, probably straight after Rogers was injured, perhaps aided by the single rope before it was thrown down by the group above. He did so quickly, not bothering to get more clothing from his rucksack. When he got there, he stood on the ledge. He then secured himself by looping a Prusik sling, connected to his harness, around the double rope just above the point it was threaded through Rogers’ abseil device. Wet and freezing, Charles died attempting a courageous rescue. He was unable to get Rogers down those last 10 metres. Cold water can quickly make hands as clumsy as clubs. It’s possible Charles was unable even to get himself down, that he became trapped on the rope once his fingers could no longer undo his sling. And it’s also possible he simply refused to leave his friend alone in such a bleak spot.

The autopsy report says Charles’s death was due to hypothermia, but doesn’t pinpoint the time more precisely than between 6.30 pm and when he was found in the morning. Two of the party believe they heard him call out in the early hours of the morning although several experts believe it unlikely he could have survived until then.

The report on Rogers says his cause of death was “not clear” at the time of the autopsy. While hypothermia was a cause, it says “the possibility of perimortem head injury and/or mechanical asphyxiation are difficult to exclude”.

Steve Ahern was in shock when he told Warner what he’d seen. But as the strongest climber in the group, he took control. Using his two Prusik slings, he climbed slowly back down the rope, worked his way past the overhang and down to the ledge. He found his friends lying backwards, suspended less than a metre above the ledge they’d been standing on. Charles was on top of Rogers, whose helmet was touching the ledge. He called out their names as he slapped them, hoping for a sign of life, hoping to revive them, desperate to get them to safety so close below.

Ahern then assumed leadership of the group. Six friends were still trapped above him. It was early Sunday morning and no-one would begin to miss them until late Monday night. He cut the Prusik cords attaching Charles to the double rope, undid Rogers’ abseiling device and both bodies slumped onto the ledge.

He tried to move them but they were too heavy and he used his whistle to call Andrew Bish to abseil down and help him. Together they tried to move the bodies out of the way so the others would not have to see them, but they stopped when they realised they were too heavy and they might easily fall themselves. One by one, the others came down, each of them passing by their dead friends, each of them distressed at what they saw.

It was close to lunchtime when they began their long trek out. They didn’t know it then but they still had about nine abseils to do, some of them in tricky spots, over ledges loaded with loose rocks or in places too cramped for more than a couple of people to wait.

By dusk on Sunday, they were still on Carra Beanga Brook. They didn’t make the junction with Kanangra Creek until Monday and didn’t begin the long, 650-metre climb out until Tuesday, by which time they’d been reported overdue and the police and SES were on their way.

When police recovered the bodies on Wednesday morning, they were no longer on the ledge. They had somehow slipped off the ledge and fallen the last 10 metres into the shallow pool at the bottom.

The silence of the group still mystifies the canyoning community. Rick Jamieson, author of Canyons Near Sydney, the canyoning guidebook the party used, has updated the notes on Carra Beanga in the new edition to better warn of the risks he believed might have contributed to the tragedy. He’d been unable, he said, to find out the facts.

Until recently, the Newcastle University Mountaineering Club (NUMC) Web site made no mention of the club’s greatest tragedy, although it had a link to another site describing a near disaster on the same spot in the same canyon. Now, the NUMC site includes this acknowledgment of that terrible weekend, written by the vice-president, Steven Ahern:

‘Steve and Mark represented everything the club stands for. They loved life and they lived it to the fullest. They took what they had been given and did great things with it, often to the enjoyment of those around them. I know that they would love nothing more than to see the NUMC have another year enriched with the pleasures that the outdoors, our own company, and our adventures and sports provide for us.”

A tragedy of errors:

After completing the canyon trip, Good Weekend asked professional guide Lucas Trihey for his assessment of what might have happened. He said: “The major thing that struck me was how cold it was and consequently how quickly hypothermia would have set in for those guys who were wearing inadequate clothing and no wet-weather gear.

” … It’s surprising how quickly the hand muscles lose their strength when they get cold and numb. If Mark was trying to do something complicated like undo knots … then even mild hypothermia would have made it impossible very quickly.

“The real issue is that there seem to have been a series of minor errors which, taken together, meant that the group was in a poor position to handle an incident such as Steve’s accident while on the rope.” In Trihey’s view, the group started relatively late for such a long, remote canyon, and kept going after dark while underdressed for such cold and wet conditions.

“For such a large group,” he says, “there seemed to be too few experienced people capable of investigating the cause of the delay after Mark and Steve disappeared.”

Given that the group was tired and cold, darkness had fallen, and they were getting confused messages from the canyoners below, it isn’t hard to see why they decided to stay put and wait until morning broke.

So what are the lessons of the tragedy, according to Trihey? “There’s a fine line with this sort of trip between everything going well and having a major epic. Sometimes a seemingly minor incident can tip the balance.” To minimise the chances of problems on long, remote canyons, Trihey says these guidelines may help:
– A maximum group size of six for remote canyons means quicker (and safer) trips but still allows a healthy safety margin if someone is hurt.
– Allow plenty of time to get to the destination or to at least reach a safe place to spend the night.
– Thermal, fleece and quality waterproof clothing are essential for all trips.
– At least one member of the group should have done the trip before. A person with good technical skills and experience should be last down and should be equipped with gear (preferably including a spare rope) for rescue use.",Main,"This accident was the culmination of a series of errors. The large group, including many beginners, attempted a challenging canyon in winter. They started far too late in the day. As a result, they were in the midst of the canyon when the sun set, forcing them to continue descending a challenging canyon with cold, fatigued, inexperienced people. It highlights how a series of small failings can lead to fatal consequences."
behunin,Behunin Canyon,"On Friday, September 5, 2003, Christopher Frankewicz, age 37, of Springdale, Utah, fell while canyoneering through Behunin Canyon. This is a rugged canyoneering route that involves route finding off the West Rim Trail, eight rappels up to 165 feet each, and normally requiring approximately eight hours. Frankewicz was traveling alone, and intended to complete the trip in one day. Friends reported him overdue late Friday evening, and a ground search was begun early on Saturday morning. By late morning, a helicopter joined the search. Frankewicz’s body was found just after noon at the base of the fifth rappel (out of nine rappels) in the middle of the canyon. It appears that he fell 60-80 feet, possibly while attempting to locate the rappel station. A technical raise and helicopter long-line were used to remove his body from the canyon.",Main,Solo canyoneering involves significant added risk and is not recommended.
barranco-de-fecha,Barranco de Fecha,"My husband and I descended this canyon when we were beginners. It wasn’t clear what gear to carry on oneself. There is one rappel called El Colector (The Collector). There is a very vertical, fixed handline there to avoid rappelling in the flow. We did not have tethers to connect to the line. Hence, we were unable to reach the safe anchor. We decided to rappel directly down the waterfall. This was not a good idea. There was too much water. I descended first with my pack attached to my harness between my legs (caving style). In this way I could avoid the flow of the water but just in the first meters of the waterfall. I started with one leg on each wall just below the anchor. Slowly the walls widened. I am 1.54 meters tall. Eventually I could no longer span between the two walls, and slipped into the full force of the waterfall. On reaching the bottom I detached from the rope and stood on a rock 2 metres in front of the waterfall. My pack was being dragged with the flow, threatening to pull me into the water and over the next drop. By the time I realized this, it was too late. I was able to sit on the rock with the pack downstream, pulling me. I was trapped. I didn’t have my knife to cut free the pack. I had to calm myself and concentrate. I had the rope in my hand but I was no longer attached to it with my rappel device. These were the worst moments in my life. I was thinking “I have to fight, this could NOT be my last moment…” I tried to pull the pack to raise it. However, it was trapped between rocks. Finally, I was able to free the pack. I managed to raise it. I attached my rappel device and finished the rappel. My legs were shaking. Ah. And after this rappel we lost another pack on a pool. I had to take off my neoprene and dive to rescue it.",Main,"It is critical to be prepared with the proper equipment. It is important to know the risks of each descent and techniques needed to mitigate those risks. Always carry a standard kit, including a tether, knife, flotation aid, etc. Never hang the pack below you in high flow. If you have to enter the flow; carry the pack over one shoulder, throw the pack or send it on a zip line."
englestead-hollow-2005-08-20,Englestead Hollow,"from Benny R:

We did Englestead on Saturday. We met a group of 11 people from St. George at the 300 foot rappel. From our conversation, I understood that the leader of the group works with Bo. We combined our 300 foot rope with theirs to make it easier for all. We passed them at about the third rappel. About 30 minutes down canyon, the leader of this group and another caught up to us and passed us, saying that a large rock (200 pounds?) had fallen on someone’s foot and basically severed his big toe. We offered to help, but there wasn’t much we could do. Three of the group stayed behind with the injured, these two raced down to find a ranger (and made it in record time I would guess — a full 3 hours faster than us and we were moving well) and the other 5 worked their way down the canyon behind us. We saw a helicopter fly away as we drove into Zion Ponderosa Ranch for the shuttle. I always wondered how rescues in Englestead work since it is out of the park, but just barely. The group had a permit and were planning on going through to the Narrows.

From Bo Beck:

It was Zack’s Brother in Law….He lost his left big toe…..sandals! Maybe could have been saved if he’d been wearing shoes or boots?…..It happened after the canyon opens up, after the 4th rappel then you come to some boulders to climb over….he grabbed a boulder to scramble over and it slid back onto his foot….It nearly severed the left big toe just in front of the joint, so he didn’t lose the whole toe. He’s in the hospital for a couple days to watch infection…A 580 foot raise to the South West rim and a helicopter ride to awaiting medical attention. Hopefully it doesn’t interfere with his balance too much? Another argument to wearing protective boots or shoes while in canyons?",,
heaps-2007-06-04,Heaps Canyon,"On June 4, 2007, Keith Beidermann, age 48, of Garden Grove, California, fell to his death while canyoneering in Heaps Canyon. This is a technical canyon with numerous potholes. It requires a very long day or two days to complete. Depending on the amount of water in the potholes, it can be very exhausting. The final sequence involves three rappels on a near vertical face. The last rappel is 285 feet long.

Beidermann was accompanied by two other canyoneers. At the final sequence of rappels, the first of Beidermann’s partners was lowered so that he could retrieve a 300-foot rope that they had previously hidden in the rocks below (before starting their hike). During the lowering, the rope became stuck on a ledge for a bit, then fell, and became tangled. This required an extra 45 minutes to get the rope untangled. It was now dark. Once the first man was all the way down, and the hidden 300-footer was found, Beidermann hauled it up to the bird perch anchor. This rope was used by the second man to rappel to the bottom. The second man rappelled without incident, although the first man down had to help slow down his descent several times by using a fireman’s belay (pulling on the brake rope).

Upon completing the 285-foot final rappel, Beidermann’s two companions were at the Upper Emerald Pool waiting for him to descend. It was unknown at the time why Beidermann, who was an experienced canyoneer, fell the entire drop to his death. Once his companions determined that Beidermann had not survived the fall, they hiked down the trail to Zion Lodge, and reported the incident to Zion Dispatch at 11:30 p.m. Park Rangers responded to the scene and confirmed that it was a fatality.

Later, investigators determined that the carabiner-block that Keith had used was set so that both the carabiner and the rope that was tied to it, slid through a second carabiner it was supposed to be blocked against. Beidermann was connected to this rope that slid through, forcing him to plunge from the anchor all the way to the ground.

Later, investigators determined that Keith had set a carabiner-block up against the large carabiner he used for lowering, which was clipped into and hanging from the small rap-ring. When he initially weighted the rope, it was fine, but something shifted when Beidermann was on the rappel, and not far below the anchors. The carabiner-block slipped through the large carabiner (acting as the rap ring), and his rope was released from the anchor. That is what caused him (with his rope) to plunge 300 feet to his death.",Main,"Anchors need to be properly set up and checked. One method of a block is a carabiner-block. It is set with a clove hitch tied to the spine of a large carabiner. This carabiner should be locked. Its size must be significantly larger than the ring (or rapide) that it blocks up against. The carabiner-block should not be blocked against another carabiner, especially one of the same size. If the blocking carabiner is smaller than the anchor ring, it can slip through the ring, causing catastrophic consequences."
claustral-canyon-2007-12-06,Claustral Canyon,"On Thursday 6th December Ian Knapp, a 61 year old Sydney man with ten years canyoning experience, died in Claustral Canyon. The victim and another experienced canyoner in the group had completed this section of the canyon without major incident at least ten times previously. On this trip the victim was with three others when he got into trouble on the final technical obstacle before the exit track; a rock that blocks the canyon that is usually descended with the aid of a hand line.

At this point there are two options for descent; either down the groove on the left (facing downstream) that usually has water flowing down it, or alternatively on the right which is usually free of water. Both options have been known to have a fixed rope in place and there is a log anchor on the right (often with slings around it) that would allow descent by staying out of the main flow of water. It is also possible to drop off the centre of the rock into a pool of water although care must be taken to avoid a large rock that is often just under the water. A number of people have been injured here after hitting the rock. In low water the left groove is an easy scramble that for most becomes a safe slide into the water as it becomes hard to hold the handline.

The group arrived at the rock that blocks the canyon at about 2pm. The other three in the group descended the open V-shaped groove on the left, using the fixed, knotted rope as a hand line and waited at the bottom. When the man started to descend he stepped into the groove about 1.5m further back than where his companions entered the groove. He sat down (facing downstream) in the water, looking as though he was going to slide forward down the groove in the running water. He was holding the hand line. Those watching from the bottom saw him sit down, then wriggle and move to try and slide forward but he seemed to be stuck and couldn’t move. The main flow of water was pushing on his back. After a few minutes of struggling unsuccessfully to move he slumped forward and the water flowed over him. The cause of death is not yet known.

One of the group managed to climb back up but was unable to free the man. He then dropped a rope down and the other two in the group prusiked up to help. They set up a hauling rig with a 4:1 mechanical advantage to try and free the man and although they could lift him a small amount they were unable to free him.

Later efforts by police rescue officers to recover the body took considerable time to free the man from where he had become severely wedged in the groove.

Due to poor weather it was not until Sunday that the man’s body was evacuated by helicopter.

Water level:

The water level at the time of this accident was higher than what’s been regarded as normal in the past decade or so yet would probably not be regarded as extreme by most Blue Mountains canyoners. By way of an indicator of relative water flow the water flowing through the keyhole abseil in Claustral was about 15cm deep. One of the survivors of the group commented that he and the victim had previously negotiated the same obstacle in higher water conditions without
incident. The weather at the time was fine and there had been no rain that day.

Comments from the group:

The survivors, some of whom have 15 years canyoning experience, comment that ropes should not be left fixed in places where their use in high water might lead others into the moving water and potential danger. Fixed equipment tends to give the impression that “this is the way”. The survivors request that fixed rope should be removed if found in this groove. There is a safe high water alternative on the other side of the canyon (on the true right).

One of the canyoners in this group with extensive experience of canyons in Europe commented that in Europe where they often experience very high water flows in canyons they never use fixed scramble lines that take you into the main stream of water.",ICAD,"<p>Water poses serious hazards, even when it does not appear to be particularly dangerous. In combination with a canyon environment, where rocks and other obstacles can be unseen, or water flows can be much higher, this risk is greatly amplified. Water flow combined with an obstacle can shift bodies in unexpected ways or cause entrapment and drowning. Putting a back or a pack or even a foot into water flow dramatically increases the surface area, and therefore force, exerted, and can do so with catastrophic consequences. Because even simple positions or incidents like a small slip can cause serious injury or death, canyoneers need to be especially mindful to work as a team and constantly look out for each other; never separating too far from the rest of the group or being in a position where you are alone without assistance. On rappels, it is not a bad idea to have someone at the top and someone at the bottom at all times, spotting, watching for hazards, or assisting in the event of an emergency. “Go ahead, I’ll catch up” is a risk.</p><p>Canyoning is an inherently dangerous activity, and water (even if not swift) increases that level of danger. Although we may not always be able to help those who need it, and we may not always get the outcome we desire even if we do the right thing, we should try to place ourselves in a position where we can help each other if we need to, or make the best effort we can to help without, risking additional injury or loss of life. As a non-competitive team sport, canyoneers need to be mindful of our own safety and ability to help others, but also everyone else’s safety and their ability to help us. Good communication, good attitudes, and good team dynamics are critical for continued, safe, descent of canyons.</p>"
claustral-canyon-2007-12-06,,,Main,Most Blue Mountains canyon descents are completed in very low water flow conditions and consequently many canyoners do not have an awareness of swift water factors. When water flows are above “normal” canyoners should show extreme caution. Moving water often looks harmless and un-spectacular yet can still have enough force to trap a canyoner or carry them into danger. This was the second fatality due to moving water in Blue Mountains canyons in a three year period.
pine-creek-2008-07-30,Pine Creek,"On Thursday, July 30, 2008, paramedic rangers were called out to rescue a canyoneer in Pine Creek Canyon, after she fell 100 feet while rappelling the last drop.
Kaitlyn Bohlin, age 23, of Northfield, Illinois, suffered multiple injuries and was taken by helicopter to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas. Bohlin was a back-country volunteer in Zion, and was canyoneering with a friend on her day off―following a route she had completed in the past. She fell around 2:45 p.m., as she went to weight the rope and anchor, on the final 100-foot free-hanging rappel. After she crashed to the ground, the group ahead of her ran back to her aid. Miraculously, she awoke after being unconscious, but could not move, as it appeared she had multiple injuries to her pelvis, spine, and lungs. Her canyoneering partner called the Tunnel ranger for help on Bohlin’s park radio. Paramedic rangers responded quickly, and they rappelled from the Tunnel to where Bohlin was being cared for by the other canyoneering group. The rangers carried Bohlin to an area where an Air Force Blackhawk helicopter, from Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, lifted her and transported her to the medical center in Nevada.
Kaitlyn fully recovered a few months later, and considered the pain and recovery time a small price to pay for falling one hundred feet (and she was not even wearing a helmet!) As she later wrote in an article online titled I Fell 106 Feet. And Lived: “No brain damage. No permanent injuries. One spinal fusion. One giant mystery. What exactly happened with my equipment that day? No one is certain, but the official investigation speculates that I clipped into the pull-cord side of the rope rather than the anchored side. It seems like a painfully obvious mistake, one that couldn’t have possibly happened amidst my double-checking and reassuring explanations before stepping off the edge. It doesn’t make sense, and I don’t pretend to understand. In the end, I’m just thankful. Mistakes happen. Accidents happen. And so do miracles.”",Main,Triple check yourself and your rappel setup before going over the edge.
kanangra-main-canyon-2009-10-18,Kanangra Main Canyon,"Early in my canyoning days. We were a group of 3 descending Kanangra Main Canyon. After descending the 9th abseil (approximately 10 meters) I decided to climb back up a slippery rock slope to the anchor (seemed like a good idea at the time). I only made it halfway. As I was descending the slippery rock face I slipped. I slid for 2 meters then fell another 3 meters resulting in fractured tibia and large cut to leg.
We only had small skinny bandages in our first aid kit and used these to try and support the ankle and cover the cut.
We considered calling for help but we could not get reception to put a phone call out (using 112 for emergency). We did not carry a PLB on that trip.
We shifted all the gear in my pack to other two packs. With assistance from the others I made my way slowly down the last few abseils and up the steep climb out. We made it to the cars sometime towards midnight then drove to hospital.
Hospital staff advised that the inadequate bandages used had contributed to severity of injury and advised on adding several large compression bandages to our kit.",Main,<ul><li>Good judgement must be used when deciding to climb rock without belay.

nobe-young-canyon-2010-07-04,Nobe Young Creek,"We drove out the afternoon before meeting early evening at a turnout on what I've decided to call Last Chance Meadow Rd (SqNF 22S02). The following morning we setup the shuttle and drove to the trailhead on GWDH. 

We proceeded down the old logging road and made the requisite right turn at about 6275ft onto another abandoned logging rd. At about 6200ft start looking for a use trail on the left. This takes you to the falls on the map. About 100ft down there is a lesser use trail heading up to the top of the falls. We by-passed this first & best rappel in Nobe Young Creek as the water flow was a bit high and it was pretty cool on this early July morning.

 Of course when I got out my camera I discovered I'd left my battery in the charger at home grrrrr ***** was appointed our official photographer as **** camera took a bit of a tumble 150ft down a waterfall a few weeks back.

We completed donning our wetsuits and started down canyon about 8:30am. About 6015ft I encountered some signs of Marijuana farming operations , cautious inspection showed it is old, with no recent activity.

Shortly down canyon @ 9:10am we came to our first rappel but R2 in Nobe Young Creek. (36.01780, -118.55358, 5948) Unlike R1 this rappel and all the others below here are dome like but steep cascades, though we rappelled canyon right off a bomber tree down a nearly vertical wall staying on rope over the wet slickrock for a total of about 75ft.

A bit further on is R3, we opted to get into the water here for a total drop of about 100ft, other options abound, we anchored canyon right around a stout tree. 
Scrambling over boulders and down trees quickly brought us to “Hand Break Falls” R4 the “best” option here was the water course as the canyon right and left was choked with brush and snags. The anchor is high in a tree mid-canyon , **** went first being our official photographer, it was clear this was the slipperiest  of our rappels so far. 

**** disappeared into the brush, A single blast of the whistle reassured us she was safely down and off rope. Johanna went right around the tree directly in the water and from my vantage point, high  on the left I figured I could do a bit better. I got on rope and scrambled down... Oops I'm not going far with my tether clipped into the anchor! 

After figuring I'd get further without the tether clipped into the anchor I got into the ankle deep water. I turned backwards assuming the rappelling stance. *** handed me the rope bag and when clipping it on to my harness I slipped going face forward I put out my right hand, it hit the granite hard (crack) Oh shit! Damm that hurt! Fucking Shit that hurt! Kept it in the cold water for a minute or two and tried to move it, everything moves but it sure hurts. 

**** takes the rope bag and asks if I'm OK? Not really but I can get down, I used a two hand grip on the rope as my right hand was weak.
 
**** had explored down canyon a bit and came to an awesome bowl like area with many different rappel opportunities, after carefully examining my hand I determined there was no displacement though it didn't look good. We opted to skip the water and stayed dry down the steep slick rock canyon left R5 about 100ft. To a broad ledge, here we opted again to stay dry and stayed canyon left R6 for about 40ft into the bushes and boulders.

Probing the boulder field looked daunting, I went high canyon left on the slickrock and staying there bypassing several nice drops and one interesting slot like area. At this point it was getting hot, especially with a wetsuit on. We stopped in the shade of a nice pine tree and had a bit of chow and lost some of the hot gear. This was about 11:45am (36.01613,-118.54857,5417ft)  

A check of the GPS showed we where less than 10th mile from the exit though to look at it we where miles from anywhere.

We made it to the lower trailhead about 12:20pm without anymore rappels but there could be if you wanted there to be. Despite injuring my hand I agreed it is a wonderful little canyoneering adventure!

We made it back to the upper trailhead somewhat relived no break ins and headed home.

The following day after bruising started showing on the palm of my right hand it was time to confirm what I already knew. I fractured something.

The x-ray reveled midway on the 4th metacarpal a goodly fracture, bummer! Ah well it will heal and I'll be back.",Main,"After reflecting I would say I was not using the stickiest of canyoneering shoes, while they maybe OK for San Gabriel Canyons, 5.10 Canyoneers C4/S1 will be my choice for Sierra Canyons in the future. I'd say it might be better to not screw around in the water just get down. I was also unfamiliar with Sierra Canyons and the very slick nature of the rock and the  ubiquitous slime through out the region"
spry-2010-07-24,Spry,"On July 24, 2010 Joe Cain, David Frankhouser and Jason Fico, three Las Vegas canyoneers were descending Spry Canyon. Over one inch of rain dumped in the canyon’s headwaters in a 30-minute time period. The weather forecast had indicated a 30% chance of rain for the day. Spry Canyon requires a dozen rappels, the longest being 165 feet.

By mid-afternoon they were mostly through the canyon. They heard thunder but had no way of knowing that the National Weather Service had upgraded the forecast to a flash flood warning. A swirling red river came out of nowhere, quickly rising from the canyon floor. There was no option for the canyoneers to escape. They were in a deep, narrow chamber mid-canyon. Water was filling up around them. They were clinging to a single rope anchored into the rock wall. Rocks, leaves, and sand fell down and pelted them as the heavy rains drenched them from above. All three were experienced rock climbers, and they considered chimney climbing up the rock face―a move that climbers use to shimmy up or down between two walls. Cain said there was no way he could have climbed up the walls that were as slick as ice. “What could we do? We were grasping for straws. “I thought I was going to die,” Cain added. “There was actually enough time to think about that, and I was thinking about my kids and them not having a dad. It was very terrifying. We had to hang on for dear life until we couldn’t hang on anymore and we got lucky,” he said.

Finally, too tired to hang on any longer, they dropped into the water. They were tossed through a narrow corridor in the canyon until they tumbled over a 40-foot cliff.

Cain survived the fall with a broken tailbone, torn muscle tissue in his back, and a one-inch-deep puncture wound in his knee. He landed in an eddy and swam over to some rocks. “The way I came out and landed, I popped out,” Cain said. “The way the current was flowing, it was enough. The water was shoulder deep. I got myself up on a rock, and I saw blood running down my leg and my back hurt. But I wasn’t paralyzed!”


After he climbed down a little ways, a group of hikers ahead saw or heard him, and they helped him climb to safety. He asked if they saw his friends. They waited for 10 or 12 minutes until someone finally spotted the other two―one walking, and one injured. “This was a miracle, because for those moments, I thought I was the sole survivor,” Cain said.


Frankhouser and Fico had both been swept over an additional cliff, falling 60 feet more, while the water pressure forced their heads underwater. At times, Fico said, he lost consciousness from the turbulent surge. “I guess I could have crawled and possibly gotten out, but David grabbed me and got me out of there,” Fico said. “I could barely move. I felt myself blacking out, and I grabbed onto the first thing I saw. I realized my leg wasn’t working.”


Fico suffered a broken hip. Six screws were used to hold the bone together, and he had to use crutches to get around for a period of time. Frankhouser survived the two combined drops of 100 feet almost unscathed, except for a few bumps and bruises on his leg. “There was probably 18 inches of this dirty, gritty foam that was on top of the water,” he said. “It was coming up and going over my head, and I couldn’t breathe. I remember landing. My shoes were blown off, and I had those neoprene socks on and they were gone too. I was barefoot―I remember feeling sand in my toes, and I couldn’t believe I didn’t have shoes on. It was all very surreal!”


The trio waited for help at the mouth of Spry Canyon with two other groups of hikers. Someone had a headlamp, and they set it on strobe mode in order to signal for help. Park ranger Ray O’Neil was off duty at the time, but decided to check the canyon because of all the rain. “I looked across and saw at the mouth of Spry Canyon this huge waterfall coming out,” O’Neil said. He radioed two on-duty rangers. All three rangers saw the flashing headlamp. The three canyoneers were rescued two hours later. Cain and Fico were airlifted to a hospital in Saint George, Utah.",Main,"Under normal weather conditions, a rain forecast of 30% for the Zion area means there is a 30% chance that any Zion slot canyon will experience flash flooding. It is not possible to forecast which particular canyons will get hit. This accident occurred during Monsoon season, when the weather is less predictable and forecasts are less reliable. Extra caution is advised when making the Go/No-go decision during Monsoon season, and any time a flash flood advisory is in effect."

rubio,Rubio Canyon,"A canyoneer was descending Thalehaha Falls in Rubio Canyon during wet conditions. He slipped on the slick granite while on rappel and let go of the rope. He was using an auto-block which was incorrectly rigged, and thus failed to catch him. He sustained an approximate 60 foot fall down the falls though he did not suffer from any serious injuries. Per his partner, “It was miraculous that he walked away with nothing but deep bruises. Credit the shallow pool, slight slope of the face, landing on his butt, and the redirection the auto-block created which contributed some friction.”",Main,"When using an auto-block, it is crucial to evaluate canyon conditions for appropriateness and properly rig the device. A bottom belay should be offered for beginner canyoneers whenever possible. Though it is a challenge to think quickly and rationally in an emergency, practicing rope skills can help prepare canyoneers for tough situations."
imlay,Imlay,"An incident involved seven canyoneers in Imlay Canyon, who requested help for two people in their group who had taken separate falls. [It should be noted that canyoneering permits in Zion do not allow group sizes greater than six. This group attempted to circumvent this rule by obtaining two permits, and broke their group into two groups; however, two affiliated groups are not permitted in the same canyon or drainage the same day as well.] Members of this group began their descent of Imlay Canyon on July 16. This canyon is arguably right up there with the same difficulty as Heaps―it’s also one of the park’s most technical canyoneering routes. Imlay requires over 20 rappels, extremely cold water swims, and numerous potholes requiring specialized techniques in order to escape.
As members of this group were completing a 10-foot rappel, using a log that was jammed crosswise in the canyon as an anchor, the log anchor failed, and a 20-year-old man who was on the rope, fell, and appeared to have suffered a lower leg fracture. The injured man was moved a short distance down canyon to a wide area known as the Crossroads, and the group spent the night there with him. The next morning (Sunday, July 17), one party member stayed with the injured man, while the remaining five canyoneers continued on the route down Imlay, promising to send help once their trip was complete.
Late in the afternoon, this group of five arrived at Imlay’s last rappel―which is a 140-foot free-hanging rappel above the middle part of the Narrows. The first canyoneer completed the rappel, and then without waiting for anyone else in his party to come down, he sprinted on ahead of his group towards the Temple of Sinawava trailhead―two miles downstream―in order to report the previous day’s incident.
The group was using a carabiner-block technique at this last anchor―allowing party members to rappel on one strand of rope, while using a second strand of rope (tied together to the first rope), that functions as a pull-cord. When used correctly, a clove hitch knot (tied to the spine of a carabiner) jams itself and the rope against a rap-ring (which is looped into the anchor). This prevents the pull-cord side of the rope from pulling through the anchor while the canyoneer is weighting the other side of the rope―which is used for the rappel. The canyoneer is thus able to rappel on a single strand of rope. It is critical that the canyoneer connects his or her rappel device to the correct side of the anchor. A good backup measure is to tie off the carabiner-blocked side of the rope until the last person is ready to rappel. This helps reduce the odds of an accident occurring.
However, this group did not tie off the carabiner block, and so when the second-to-last member went to rappel the drop, she mistakenly attached her device on the wrong side of the anchor―the pull-cord side. When she leaned back over the edge and put weight on the rope, she fell the entire distance into the shallow rushing river of the Narrows below―a distance of 140 feet. Her life was most likely saved by the friction from the bunching and twisting of the rope as it whipped through the rap-ring anchor―slowing her fall just enough at the last second, to prevent her from landing at full speed.
While a ranger at the trailhead was taking information from the group’s runner concerning the initial lower leg fracture of the man in the vortex of Imlay, a separate tourist rushed to the trailhead to give the report of the woman from the same group, who had fallen 140 feet. Rangers quickly organized a carryout via raft litter, and evacuated the woman to the trailhead. They did not get her out until shortly after midnight. Miraculously, her most serious injury was only a shattered ankle!
The next morning, Monday, July 18, Grand Canyon National Park’s contract helicopter and short-haul team was used again―this time for evacuating the man with the initial lower leg fracture out of the center of Imlay Canyon. The use of the helicopter’s short-haul prevented the need for a long, difficult technical rope rescue. Charges concerning the group’s permit violations (exceeding six people) were pending at the time of the incident.",Main,"Lacking details on the log-anchor failure, it can only be said that this anchor was probably not properly assessed before use, or perhaps was misused. As to the other accident, rappelling on the retrieval side of a blocked single rope is a potentially deadly mistake. A good way to reduce the risk: attach the retrieval side of the rope to the anchor with a locking carabiner, ideally with the retrieval rope packed in a rope bag that is also clipped to the anchor.

It should also be noted that the group size limit for Imlay Canyon is 6 people. Two affiliated groups are not permitted in the same canyon or drainage the same day."
subway-2012-09-18,The Subway,"On Tuesday, September 18, 2012. Seventy-four-year-old Yoshio Hosobuchi and his wife were descending the Subway, making the last drop into the popular and photographic slot portion of the canyon. The retired neurosurgeon’s rappel device jammed, and he became stuck upside-down in a waterfall after he attempted to cut himself out of his climbing harness waistband with a knife. For some unknown reason, he chose to cut his harness waistband instead of cutting the rope. When he cut the harness, his body slipped upside-down, and his leg straps became entangled around his ankles. His elderly wife, who had reached the canyon bottom first, could reach up and touch his fingertips as he hung. She was not able to climb back up to assist him, so she headed down canyon for help. Zion National Park Chief of Interpretation, Aly Baltrus, said that neither Hosobuchi nor his wife was an experienced canyoneer, but they were not complete novices either.


“They actually had taken a course―just an introductory course on canyoneering, which we recommend to everybody. They had also gone through Keyhole Canyon first, which is a much easier descent,” she said. Rescuers are not sure why Hosobuchi decided to use the log anchor to descend the waterfall. Perhaps he did not see the standard anchors nearby that allow for rappelling down a ramp 30 feet for the final drop. Once stuck on the rope, due to the accidental jamming of his safety device known as an auto-block, he might not have had the experience to recover. An auto-block is an extra precaution useful to add friction and safety, in case the rappeler accidentally lets go of the rope with their brake-hand side. An auto-block is often recommended and useful on long, overhanging drops, but is usually not used for short drops; nor is it recommended while rappelling through flowing water.


Another canyoneer, who had passed Hosobuchi in the canyon prior to the accident, noted that the couple was moving at a slow pace, and he thought that they would likely not reach the exit by nightfall. That person alerted park rangers at about 9 p.m. Tuesday. However, the park staff opted not to launch a full-scale search at night―not realizing that the tragedy had already taken place.


Hosobuchi’s wife gradually made her way down canyon, but was unfamiliar with the Subway exit route, and did not manage to make contact with rescuers until late Wednesday morning. By the time rescuers reached Hosobuchi in the Subway, he had perished. A helicopter retrieved his body from the canyon on Thursday. It was believed that hypothermia, exposure, and complications from spending a prolonged amount of time inverted on the rope were contributing factors.",Main,"<ul><li>Anchor choice</li><li>Autoblock is expert technique</li><li>Autoblock no good in moving water</li><li>All canyoneers should have the skill and gear to ascend a rope. The equipment to ascend needs to be readily available on the harness.</li></ul>

fallenbach,Fallenbach,"Two women, aged 24 and 23, were part of a commercially guided group caught in a flash flood in the canyon. The bodies of the two women were found several hours after being swept downstream, after a helicopter search had to be called off due to bad weather. Three members of the group were taken to hospital with minor injuries. A second group was also in the canyon at the time of the accident, but all members of that group were safely rescued.

A criminal investigation for negligent homicide in this incident was unable to determine the exact cause of the flash flood. Possible factors included heavy local rainfall, natural dams giving way, and water released from underground chambers. The investigation concluded that the sudden rise in water was unforeseeable. Note that that some of the local guide services had ceased operations for the season, due to the unpredictability of October weather in the region.",,
heaps-2012-10-09,Heaps Canyon,"Rescue from Heaps: October 9, 2012

Day 1: Saturday, October 6

On October 6, 2012, Sam and Laura set out to do Heaps Canyon in Zion National Park. They picked up their Heaps permit at the ZNP Backcountry Desk around 9 am, telling the ranger that they expected to complete the canyon in one day. They also said they were prepared to spend the night if necessary. Sam’s pack was large and heavy, loaded down with the bulk of their equipment, which included 550 feet of rope, a 330’ pull cord and “about 8 pounds of emergency stuff.” Laura wore a smaller day pack.

The pair hiked up the West Rim Trail and began descending the Gunsight entry route, arriving at the first rappel around lunch time. The Gunsight proved to be much slower than anticipated: there were practically no fixed anchors and Sam said the route looked as if it had been scoured by floods. There were no signs of any recent descent and they found the process of building natural anchors to be slow and challenging.

At the bottom of a rappel, Laura’s foot slipped and her ankle scraped into a crack in the rock. The injury was described as “road rash” which they treated with antibacterial ointment and an Ace bandage. Laura had had past problems with the ankle and though the injury wasn’t serious, it slowed progress further and had a negative impact on her mental state. Sam said later, “If we had someone who had done the canyon, I suspect we would of climbed out after Laura got hurt. If not we would of gone a lot faster. We stopped a lot to gage our location and decide on which route to take.” That day they made it to a point about about 3/4 of the way down the Gunsight, where they bivied.

Day 2: Sunday, October 7

Sam and Laura rose early and continued down the Gunsight toward Heaps Canyon. Progress was significantly slower than the day before. Laura had experienced a significant loss of confidence from the previous day’s ankle injury. Physically, she was moving very slowly and had also become hyper-cautious, questioning every move they made. The effect of this was a tendency to over-think every anchor placement, which led to many time-consuming discussions and anchor reconfigurations.

They eventually made their way into Heaps and camped somewhere before the crossroads. Sleeping was comfortably warm the first two nights of the trip as there was ample fuel at both bivy sites for a small fire.

Day 3: Monday, October 8

Progress continued slowly and with difficulty. Laura was clearly very discouraged and showing signs of mild hypothermia. At around 3 pm they arrived at a wide, sandy spot about somewhere between 1000’ – 2000’ into the 3rd narrows section. Laura expressed a strong desire to try climbing out of the canyon to warm up in the sunlight, tantalizingly out of reach over 100’ overhead. There was a good view of the sky there, and it appeared that an exit might be possible. Gear was unpacked and options for climbing out were explored, but without success. The walls were covered in damp moss, so free-climbing was ruled out, and the nearest viable hook point was far out of reach. Up to this point, Sam had not wanted to push Laura, fearing that in her weakened state she might get seriously hurt due to a misstep or error. Now, having failed to realize an escape, Sam pushed to keep moving down canyon as he was concerned that night would fall before they could exit the narrows. They had no clear picture of the terrain ahead and the prospect of treading water in the dark was a prime motivator. They had about 2 more hours until sunset.

While re-packing their gear, a helicopter was heard briefly overhead. They waved but were unsure they were seen, and the helicopter left. After pausing for a short prayer, they resumed movement and Laura seemed to be doing better. A short distance down canyon, they encountered a 30’ drop and began rigging a rappel. At this point they again heard the helicopter and Laura was elated. With greatly improved mood and energy, Laura left her pack with Sam and went back up canyon to try and signal the helicopter. Sam re-packed the gear and followed her back to the sandy spot. Laura had been successful: the helicopter dropped a bag of supplies (food, sleeping pad, radio) and left. Radio communication proved to be patchy as the canyoneers’ ability to transmit was limited. However, they could receive well and understood that the helicopter would return to retrieve them the next day.

In contrast to the first two nights, the last night in the canyon was “miserable” as there was no possibility for a fire. The next day (Day 4) the two were hauled out of the Heaps narrows by a rope rescue team. They then hiked a short distance to where the helicopter had landed and were flown out.",Rescue,"NPS report:

Rangers Rescue Two Overdue Canyoneers at Zion National Park
Date: October 10, 2012
Contact: Aly Baltrus

On Tuesday, October 9, Zion National Park Rangers rescued canyoneers overdue from a hike that began Saturday, October 6. The two visitors, a 41 year old man and a 26 year old female, were attempting Heaps Canyon, one of Zion National Park’s more difficult canyoneering routes. Heaps Canyon is eleven miles long and involves a 300 foot free hanging rappel, swimming through cold water, and numerous other obstacles, including slick rock potholes which can be difficult to traverse.

At approximately 9 a.m. on Saturday, the pair picked up their wilderness permit and said they estimated completing it in a day. The park ranger notified them that most people start pre-dawn in order to make Heaps Canyon a day trip. The pair said they were prepared to spend the night if necessary. While the two were never reported overdue, rangers did note that their vehicle was still parked at a trailhead on the morning of the Monday, October 8.

A helicopter from Grand Canyon was called in for the search. The helicopter crew was able to locate the canyoneers in the lower reaches of Heaps Canyon late in the afternoon of the October 8. After three days of travelling, the two had only completed about two thirds of the canyon. Some of the canyon’s most difficult obstacles still lay ahead. The crew was able to get a radio to the pair who stated that they were not able to complete the canyon without assistance. On the morning of the Tuesday, October 9, a ranger and firefighter were inserted to a bench above the two canyoneers. They cleared a helispot which enabled the helicopter to land with additional rescuers. The six member rescue team lowered a ranger from the bench 125 feet down to the stranded pair and then hauled all three people back to the bench. The two canyoneers did not require medical assistance.

The successful conclusion to the search was in part because the hikers had obtained a backcountry hiking permit which included information useful to the searchers. However, wilderness hikers should always inform someone of their plans along with an expected completion time. Had rangers not noticed the canyoneers’ vehicle at the trailhead, it is unclear when or if the two would have been reported overdue. The group also had far less experience than most Heap’s Canyon travelers. While canyon hiking (canyoneering) in Zion can be a challenging and rewarding activity, it is not one that should be entered into lightly."
heaps-2012-10-09,,,Rescue,"<p>Prior to the Heaps trip, Sam and Laura had completed a dozen easy canyons in the San Gabriel Mountains (near Los Angeles, CA) as well as two Zion canyons: Pine Creek (2010) and Behunin (2011). Both Zion trips had gone smoothly and they were looking for a greater challenge in 2012. After reading about Heaps in Tom Jones’ guidebook, “Zion: Canyoneering” and researching online beta sites, Sam’s perception was that Heaps looked like “a big Pine Creek.” This major mis-assessment of one of Zion’s most difficult canyons resulted in the pair’s decision to attempt Heaps without having a clear picture of what they were getting into. Key points from available beta were taken lightly or ignored, especially the suggestions on bringing a Heaps veteran, group size considerations, managing cold water exposure and prerequisite canyoneering experience. As Sam reflected, “Obviously, I think we kinda jumped the gun with that one.”</p><p>Once in the Gunsight, the pair’s lack of practical experience with using and building natural anchors became apparent. Laura had taken some canyoneering courses and both had watched several how-to videos but neither had any in-canyon anchor-building experience. Progress was therefore very slow, exacerbated by the effects of Laura’s ankle injury. After entering Heaps proper, their non-draining packs and thin (3mm) wetsuits added to the impediments. Said Sam: “At one point we walked for an hour to avoid a pool only to return to the pool. We thought we could go around the pools.”</p><p>Laura’s attitude and abilities declined progressively during the trip. At the time, Sam thought this was mostly due to a combination of physical factors: her ankle injury, pre-trip marathon training (lack of rest and low body fat), low upper body strength, thin wetsuit and a non-draining pack. She often struggled in places where making progress should have been relatively easy. Despite this, Sam saw her abilities revive considerably when the prospect of rescue was apparent. So much so, that he thought in retrospect she could have completed the canyon with proper coaching. Sam’s scouting background and military service (Operations Desert Storm and Restore Hope) had prepared him for dealing with adverse circumstances, and helping partners in difficulty. However, he had developed a fixed image of Laura as possessing a high degree of mental toughness and had seen nothing in their prior trips to shake that picture. As a result, he missed an opportunity to draw on his background, help his partner recover, and perhaps turn the trip around. Sam considers this his greatest mistake on the trip."
rubio-2013-03-18,Rubio Canyon,"A canyoneering group rescued a hiker who had wandered into the canyon but did not have the equipment to descend. Also, one group member rappelled off the end of a rope.

Sonny Lawrence: “This was a much different day of canyoneering. Calius Lawrence stayed home to practice piano and finish income taxes (neither of which I do very well). So Mark Binder, Jeff Lehman, John Metzger (members of the Cave and Technical Rescue Team) and Andrew from UC Riverside and I decided to do the short cut route in Rubio canyon, San Gabriel mountains, SoCal. We were 2 minutes from the car at the exit. I looked at the registry (which I never do). I read yesterday’s entry from a person who sounded suicidal. So I used my phone to copy it and emailed the note to a friend on a local rescue team. He activated the Altadena SAR team. Off we went into the canyon, not knowing what we would discover. I missed the short cut by a couple hundred feet. No problem, it just put us higher in the canyon than we originally planned. After all, we love bushwacking. We started the canyon descent and came to the first waterfall. It was already set with a short rope, about 5 feet off the deck. I went first and was trying to stay dry. I screamed off the end of the rope and landed on my back. Instant pain. Lovely. Someday I will grow up. Friends gladly unloaded my pack and off we went. Around the bend we discovered a woman, Ariana, standing there with jeans, shirt, water bottle and cell phone. She had no technical gear. She had climbed Echo mountain and got lost on her way down. She found her way into the bottom of a deep canyon. She was in for an adventure. We asked how she tolerated heights as we supplied her with necessary technical gear for the upcoming 6 rappels. She has a vague answer. However she did well considering she had never performed such feats before. We met up with the Altadena SAR team at the last rappel and walked out uneventfully. Unfortunately nothing was discovered about the possibly suicidal individual. If we had found the proper short cut route, we would have been below Ariana. She would have been spending an uncomfortable night in a deep canyon.”",Main,It is important to verify the rope reaches the bottom of the rappel.

heaps-2013-07-05,Heaps Canyon,"Three men set out on Friday (7/5), intending to canyoneer through Heaps the following day. They did not make it through the canyon on Saturday. On Sunday, after failing to show up, family members reported them overdue to the park service. Rangers immediately began to monitor the canyon exit. Due to thunderstorms on Sunday afternoon, rangers were unable to fly a reconnaissance flight, but began to plan a search for Monday morning.

The three men spent most of Sunday in a large pothole, stopped by a 30-foot-tall obstacle. On Monday morning, they climbed 100 feet up to a bench above the floor of the canyon, to await rescue. During one of the helitack’s search flights, rangers spotted the trio on the bench above the canyon. Ranger/medic Tim Hearns was inserted into the canyon by short-haul, via the helicopter, to assess injuries, and then the canyoneers were extracted one by one.

Later the party reported that they had reached what they thought was a “dead-end” in the canyon early on Saturday afternoon (not recognizing that conditions change dramatically from year to year, depending on floods and water levels). The group did not realize that they were still in Heaps Canyon, blocked by a deep “keeper pothole.”",Main,"<ul><li>Heaps Canyon becomes extremely difficult when the water level drops, and dozens of potholes become keeper potholes.

behunin-8-25-2013,Behunin Canyon,"On August 25, 2013, a group of four canyoneers barely made it down the final rappel in Behunin, just as the steady rain began to pour down like mad. After the fourth man got down off the rope, they all cheered (an online video was posted), thinking that they were “off the hook.” But then the pour-off 165 feet above them immediately began flashing so hard, that they could not pull their rope down in time. Not wanting to abandon their rope, the foursome took cover nearby, and were soon trapped under a boulder for quite some time, as immense waterfalls penned them in. They became hypothermic while huddling under the boulder for more than an hour, due to copious amounts of floodwater spurting through the boulder cracks, and squirting on them from all angles.",ICAD,"<p>Regardless of weather forecasts, teams should be prepared to spend the night in the canyon and deal with worse-than expected, adverse, weather conditions or other injuries. Keep in mind that hypothermia can occur even in warmer temperatures (eg. due to heat loss via contact with rock or water, or surfaces colder than body temperature) and even warm water. Some environments are also prone to large temperature swings throughout the day or in the evening, and windchill can result in considerable heat loss as well. A team may not be cold when moving, but if it is forced to stop and shelter, minimizing evaporative cooling and environmental protection (particularly if the stop is going to be prolonged) is essential, as it is generally easier to shed heat than it is to gain it when it has been lost in a canyon.</p><p>Environmental protection and emergency equipment doesn’t necessarily need to be complicated or expensive, and can be life saving in an emergency. For instance, large garbage bags are lightweight, inexpensive, and can be used to insulate from the wind and water, or can be stuffed with leaves to make an improvised sleeping pad along with other equipment (eg. packs, ropes, and partially inflated drybags can keep you off the ground at night). Extra calories and food intake can increase body temperatures as the body metabolizes that food, and groups can huddle together to minimize wind exposure or protect more vulnerable/hypothermic team members.</p><p>Teams should also consider pre-trip planning and communication as a vital part of success; operating as a team, equipment can be distributed and checked beforehand, and discussions about contingencies and potential scenarios not only prepares teams for those contingencies, but also helps individual team members develop that mindset and experience.</p>"

Multiple options existed for the deviation anchor, all of which were poorly placed and one of which was of inadequate strength.

Before rappelling into a known hazard, everyone in the group needs to fully understand the nature of the hazard, and how to mitigate it. The group should also discuss possible alternatives: a different rappel route, guided rappel, and retreat. Rigging for possible rescue can be a good idea in many situations, but the anchor geometry and small group size in this case might have made self-rescue impossible."

My canyon partner, friend and hero, Kyle, made heroic efforts to downclimb the waterfall, pull me from the frigid water below, cover me with his own wetsuit, then upclimb out the canyon walls, and run back out the canyon to get help. While an air rescue was dispatched, the SAR helicopter did not reach me for several hours. I was airlifted to the Kern Medical Center (KMC) in critical condition – I shattered both heels, both ankles, an open compound fracture of my right leg (tib & fib), broken pelvis, broken hand, dislocated thumb, and several lacerations to my arms and legs. My core temperature had dropped to 90 degrees, I was in hypothermia and going into renal failure.

Fortunately, due to the amazing work of the surgeons and doctors, I survived, but was in the hospital for 5 weeks and underwent 14 surgeries. Unfortunately, due to the severity of trauma and other complications, reconstructive surgery of my right foot was not possible. Ultimately, I was discharged with a crooked foot, a shattered heel, and a giant open wound on the inside of my ankle (bones and tendons exposed).

Throughout my entire recovery, I have consulted with countless specialists and experts, finding my way to Cedars-Sinai where I am working with one of the best foot & ankle experts in the country, who actually took my case before a panel of international experts due to the “difficulty” of my injuries.

The consensus view is that the only viable option to “repair” my foot is a full ankle fusion – a “TTC” fusion (tibiotalarcalcaneal). The procedure would completely fuse my entire foot and ankle using bone grafts and large steel rods, completely eliminating any mobility whatsoever in my foot. Essentially, the outcome would force me to walk with a limp and would eliminate my ability to run (or engage in any activity requiring ankle flexion).

After extensive research, investigation, medical articles and studies, countless discussions with medical experts and those with personal experience, earnest contemplation, prayers, and serious thought… I have decided that an ankle fusion is an unacceptable outcome for me and the life I want to live. So I have chosen to proceed with a different option…

I have chosen to amputate my foot and continue life with a prosthetic.

Ironically, the quality of life (mobility and versatility) with a prosthesis is vastly superior to the alternative, and should enable me to essentially return to my pre-accident status and capabilities. In some ways, it may even be superior.

However, the accident itself rendered me completely unable to work for several months, in addition to incurring several thousand dollars of medical bills, which is compounded by my new need to acquire specialty prostheses in order to return to the activities that characterize my love of life. Additionally, while insurance will [partially] cover a general “walking” prosthesis, I will need to amass a small quiver of specialty legs for my varied interests and lifestyle – most importantly, a specialized flex skiing leg (particularly important for backcountry and park riding), a “Cheetah” running leg, a waterproof surfing leg, and perhaps a custom-designed hiking/canyoneering leg.",Main,<p>Natural anchors must be thoroughly checked each time they are used.

lower-jump-canyon-2015-07-13,Jump Trip (Lower),"This occurred immediately after what’s labeled “Lateral Climb RDC” on the map for Lower Jump. After you climb on the right, you come to a small waterfall about ~4′ that you can jump into a good size pool. Prime location to jump is from the left or right of the watercourse. The right side has a boulder that must be cleared; jumping about 5 feet out will easily clear the boulder. Alternatively, one can down climb on the far right or hand line.

A canyoneer approached the location, assessed the jumping options, and unsuccessfully attempted to communicate with two canyoneers that had already negotiated the obstacle as to what they did. The canyoneer decided to jump on the right side, choosing a difficult variation on the normal boulder obstacle. He jumped, and failed to clear the boulder: the left foot was too far forward, and struck the rock.

At first nothing seemed amiss, just the initial shock/pain from impact with the rock. Swimming toward the shallow end of the pool, the canyoneer started to feel pain in the left foot as it grazed the sandy bottom, but it wasn’t until he had to stand that he realized he wasn’t able to. He could not bear any weight on the foot. He removed his shoe and neoprene sock to inspect, but nothing looked out of the ordinary. There was no deformation, no swelling, and no pain from touching the foot. However, pain was excruciating when bearing weight on the foot. From this point, there was about another mile of hiking. With a combination of rolling around, crawling on all fours, piggy back rides, and funky partner assists, the group made its way through the Toboggan area, a large waterfall, the final slog section, the last jump, and the powerhouse bypass trail.

Initial assessment with X-rays revealed nothing was broken, just a really bad sprain. Months later, a CT scan was made and it was revealed that there were in fact fractures, and some fragments. Official report: Subacute Lisfranc fracture subluxation with osseous fragments in the expected course of the Lisfranc ligament. Additional tiny chip fracture of the third metatarsal base. Resulting mild lateral subluxation of the second and third metatarsals with respect to the tarsals. Subacute fourth metatarsal base intra-articular fracture with bony bridging.

It was later learned that the reason why the fractures didn’t show up on the first x-ray was due to being an occult fracture. Not large enough to show up on x-ray initially, but once it healed and the cartilaginous base started to form, it spread the pieces apart and thus showed on the scan later.",Main,"<ul><li>Know your limitations, choose your jumps wisely and be sure to always have an alternative to jumping.</li><li>Jumping is a team activity</li></ul>"
tanner-creek,Tanner Creek,"A team of seven intermediate to expert canyoners set out on the initial day of establishing a route down then-undescended Tanner Creek. To reach the objective, the team descended a minor tributary from the east which confluences with Tanner Creek just above Wahclella Falls. The team had descended two pitches (141 feet and 75 feet) in low flow conditions. Just before reaching the final pitch at the confluence, one member of the team slipped and fell on a sharp rock, wounding her lower leg just below the knee. The patient was not wearing a wetsuit at the time due to the low water conditions. Another team member was nearby and gave first aid. The patient’s balaclava was wrapped around the leg and secured with Gorilla brand tape. This effectively stopped the bleeding. Since the weather was favorable and the tributary was nearly dry, hypothermia was not an issue.

The team quickly convened. Descending the planned route was fraught with complications: a first descent, many bolt anchors that needed to be placed, very swift water, cold conditions, high technical difficulty, and the possibility that the descent would continue into the night. The team made a decision to self rescue, with one canyoneer accompanying the injured party back to the parking area. One of the team members had scouted the location on two previous occasions and was able to find a tree along the cliff with a webbing anchor that he had left. The rope was rigged, and a best option route was scouted to get the patient safely to the anchor, about 300 ft away. The patient was carefully escorted to the tree anchor, which involved walking on uneven terrain and downclimbing a short steep section just above the anchor. One team member descended the rope about 200 feet to a scree slope above the Wahclella Falls trail. The patient then descended the pitch, while the team member below provided a bottom belay. The patient and team member walked together on the trail back to the parking area and drove to the hospital in Hood River. The patient received eight stitches and fully recovered.

The remaining five members of the team continued with the planned objective and successfully descended Wahclella Falls just after sunset.",,
not-imlay-10-2-2015,Not Imlay,"On Friday, October 2, 2015, Christian Louis Johnson, age 50, from Saint George, Utah, fell several hundred feet to his death on the first rappel, while canyoneering with three others in Not Imlay Canyon. This canyon is a side canyon of Imlay Canyon, and it has become increasingly popular in recent years as a shorter, drier route compared to Imlay Canyon; however, it is not any less technical or dangerous.


The park was alerted at 1:00 p.m. by one of the group members, and a rescue operation was started immediately. A helicopter was used to drop off a Search and Rescue team at the top of the canyon.


Johnson was canyoneering with three others, including his husband, Everett Boutillet. The two had been canyoneering together since 2010 and had “descended more than 100 canyons 200 times in five states” according to Boutillet. This was the couple’s second descent of Not Imlay Canyon. “Zion was our favorite park. Our favorite place to be. Our first canyon was the ‘Subway’ and we were instantly addicted,” said Boutillet. “Louis and I understood the risks, but the joy that it brought outweighed them.” Johnson’s mother, Joy Johnson, added “Nature gave him so much peace.”


In the weeks following this tragedy, Everett Boutillet wrote about this story online. Here are some of his comments:

“Thanks for your patience while I recover from the loss of my husband and life partner of 21 years. The moments and particularly the sounds of Louis’ fall have been seared into my mind forever. The way I see it, there were two glaringly obvious mistakes: First, why was a 100-foot rope set on a 280-foot rappel? And second, after realizing mistake number one, how did Louis react and why?


I think there is a general eagerness to get into a canyon. This may have contributed to a rushed decision. I need to state right off that Louis and I alone are responsible for what occurred that day.


I’ll get right to the fatal first rappel. As we made the final walk down the beautiful slickrock ramp, the “new anchor” stood out like a beacon. We had used it last year. Before setting the rope, I pointed out the location of the “old anchor”. There was no webbing or anchor on the tree. This is when lightning bolts of caution should have hit us. They did not. At this point, Louis and I had no memory of doing the first and second raps as one single combined rappel.


I can honestly say we both thought Louis was going down 100 feet to a ledge. Louis dumped the 200-foot rope out of its rope bag, found the ends and began to thread the rope, doubled, through the rap ring. I immediately asked him why he was doubling it. I expressed my concern about getting the doubled rope through my new rappel device, the Sqwurel. More serious concerns escaped my attention. Louis said something to the effect that “we’ve done it before, it’ll work”. I quickly acquiesced. (Now I wonder – what, a 100-foot rope on a 100-foot rappel? No room for error. The rope was in a bag, why not just send it down, listen for it to land per usual? Why not set a block with a contingency?)

 

Louis said he’d set up the next rappel and took the only other rope with him. (Should we have had another rope? Probably) Did he need to take the second rope? No, there was no need for our group of four to be in a hurry. Did the added weight contribute to his fall? Possibly.)
This first rap has a long sloping beginning. Louis went over and was gone far too long before we heard him shout up (due to the elapsed time he must have been close to the end of the rope). We had trouble hearing him. The Virgin (River) is visible and audible from there. There was also an updraft that may have made communication more difficult. I conferred with my two partners, Jeremy and Shannon, and we agreed Louis had said that the rope was too short.


I believe he repeated it and added that the end of the rope was eight feet short. This was almost certainly inaccurate. I was shown photos five days after the accident (taken from the bottom looking up). I was horrified. Louis said, “I need you to send down the other rope.” Up top, we all realized immediately that we didn’t have one. Louis realized this as well as I remember panicked silence after that.


I went down and left to the “old anchor” site, a tree at the edge. I could now see the top third or so of the line and could now hear Louis clearly. I could not see him or what exactly he was facing. Both our minds were racing. I shouted down an idea, Louis quickly rejected it. I started to say something else and Louis said “Everett, shut up” in a panicked voice. Very little was said, there wasn’t time.

 

Based on the sounds I heard next, I can only use conjecture as to what happened. Louis either slipped off the end of the rope, or he intentionally let go–thinking he could make a landing. I believe it was the latter–perhaps that’s what I need to believe. He did not scream or yell at that point. Then a series of the worst kind of sounds you hope you’ll never hear: He landed quickly but didn’t stop. Shannon first described what she heard next as “a commotion”. To me it sounded like a rolling or tumbling. Then a terrible short scream, a sickening short pause, and a final awful crash.


I have brave friends who did Not Imlay about a week later. Based on information from one of them, Louis was likely 20 feet from a landing, But it slopes downward and there are two ledges after that, neither of which could have stopped him. So the tumbling I thought I heard was likely a fall from ledge to ledge. What could have happened before that fatal moment? Louis should have looked for the bottom of the rope sooner, he should have tied off immediately, we should have established clear communication sooner, he could have hung on that rappel for 20 minutes, two hours, whatever it took. We could have figured something out if given the time to calm down and think carefully. I’m not going to list possible solutions because I frankly don’t know if my ideas would have worked.


Louis didn’t have ascenders–the rest of us did. We had always assumed we could share one pair. We have had to ascend due to stuck ropes four times (everyone needs to practice this skill more). I carried the ascenders, I was the climber. If given time we could have found a way to get ascenders to Louis. It’s important that everyone understand that he was on the rope for just a few minutes before he dropped or fell.”",ICAD,"<p>Although “toss and go” rope/team techniques have the advantage of being faster, they add elements of risk that may not be readily apparent.</p><ol>
<li>Ropes and rope bags tend to change users frequently. Since ropes can have different rappelling characteristics, even with the “same” diameter, this can add uncertainty and add to rappelling risks, as some users may find certain ropes too fast or too slow on their particular device and at their level of weight, which may require more friction adjustments, particularly on long rappels or more technical rappels.</li><li>It can be difficult to track who has what equipment if everyone is not equally equipped with ropes, ascending devices, and emergency gear. If there is a problem, a particular team may not have the equipment to deal with it, and other team members who do may be too far out of reach to communicate with or to come back.</li><li>Because teams tend to move faster, they also can become more spread out, making it more difficult for team members to assist each other or communicate in the event of a problem, particularly if there is a wide range of experience amongst the group.</li><li>Communication is more difficult, so challenging obstacles get less input and analysis from team members who may be farther behind, or too far upfront when a team towards the back experiences an unexpected problem that did not occur when the first teams were sent down (eg. signs of anchor stress, rope damage, a person having a problem, etc).</li></ol><p>Double stranded rappels, while faster to set up, are not as suited to contingencies when compared to releasable, single-line, rappels. Furthermore, if there is a need to ascend due to a problem, many devices or techniques do not work, or do not work well, on double ropes. Also, if a single rope is used for a rappel (even if a releasable anchor is not set up), the other end of the rope is available for use and could be used to lower equipment or another person to assist with a problem, or to set up a releasable anchor after the fact if additional rope length is needed. Using all of the rope by double stranding (or loading both sides of the rope with the same load) removes these options.</p><p>When building systems, due care is necessary to apply the right techniques at that moment in time for that situation; past performance is no guarantee of future performance or success, as conditions can change (eg. people’s mental or physical state, the canyon, the weather, etc) for a variety of reasons, making a “simple and easy rappel” suddenly considerably more difficult or complicated. Thus, while contingency systems may take more time and equipment, they should be used when feasible, as problems tend to occur when they are least convenient, and they often compound and grow. Problems can even occur mid rappel, or after several team members have rappeled without issue. When the decision is made to not use a system with a contingency, a contingency should be in place (eg. secondary anchor locations evaluated, equipment necessary to rescue the other person on the other system available, sufficient experience and capability of other team members, etc), as there is often little time to contemplate these things during an emergency.</p><p>In general, more experienced team members should go first, and by extension, have the means to deal with whatever problems they may encounter on their own, should the team members above not be able to assist quickly. However, having experienced team members spread throughout the group, at the top and bottom of rappels, makes self-rescues or troubleshooting issues far easier; thus, at a minimum, groups of 4 are recommended with two or more experienced canyoneers for the conditions and types of canyons being descended.</p><p>Although easier said than done, one piece of advice that has served well is, “in the event of an emergency, do not panic.” Everyone makes mistakes (particularly in hindsight), but when mistakes are made, it is important not to compound on those mistakes by making panicked or rushed decisions that can make the situation worse. The more that contingency and “what if” scenarios are discussed in advance, the less likely difficult situations will devolve into intractable problems. Thus, safety, equipment, and emergency/contingency discussions should be had even before canyons are entered, and when teams do descend, having the right mindset and equipment, and redundancy of that equipment, is critical.</p>"

heaps-2016-05-22,Heaps Canyon,"We ran Heaps this past Sunday and came across a group of three who had stayed overnight in an unplanned bivy near the head of the canyon. They sought our help as they had been expected to exit the canyon the day before. They had arranged for a friend to wait at the bottom of the final rappel, in order to pass a 300’ rope up to them. They’d had issues with leaky wetsuits and drysuits in the cold water necessitating a prolonged stay in the canyon and they were worried that they would not have a rope to exit. They were carrying a 200’ rope and a 300’ pull cord. A member of our group who had stashed his 300 foot rope offered to leave it for them if their friend and rope weren’t waiting. We continued and reached the final rappel sequence. Our group descended and readied to leave as a member of their group began to call out from above. He was struggling just below the bird perch and wearing a pack that was tipping him back. He called out that he needed to drop his pack, and then he flipped upside down. A member of our group ran over to give him a bottom belay as we communicated suggestions. He was able to remove and hang his pack, and was struggling to untangle his jacket which had become ensnared in his rappel device (a Pirana). My friend who was giving him a belay had him completely stopped and once he was free she suggested he could begin rappelling, but he said he was too exhausted. So she lowered him 200 feet to the deck. The SAR officer approached so we left.",Main,"<ul><li>Preparation is critical to a safe descent.

monkeyface-6-7-2016,Monkeyface Falls,"A canyoneer reported two ropes becoming stuck during retrieval, one of which required a  90 foot ascent in a slippery waterfall. He reported:

Monkeyface Falls last Saturday saw two stuck ropes, one by me, the other by another in our group.
I stuck mine at the top of the wet corridor with the chockstone bolt station inside it. I went down last and knew I had the rope on the riskier side, but thought I could flip it over from the bolts at the chockstone halfway. I found I could not. I then pulled most of my rope and somehow got the end stuck above (not surprising). At that point there was no way to ascend it safely. So I cut it and left about 20′-30′ behind. I had been careless – I knew it was not on the best side and could see a risky pinch as I descended by, and chose not to remedy it immediately. I also chose not to ascend and fix it when I could not flip it into a better position.


The other stuck rope was at the platform just below the corridor, 3rd from the last rappel. On this trip, everyone was given a chance to set anchors and retrieve the rope. The last person to rappel made 2 errors: (1) did not do a test pull with the second to last before descending (the rule of the day was every rap gets a test pull with second to last person) and (2) selected a path to minimize penduluming without bothering to consider the rope pull. The last person in this case had, unbeknownst to me, been rattled earlier having seen another in our group pendulum and crash into the wall. Understandably, the last rappeller chose a route with an easier entry.


However, what should have been a very easy rope pull from the bottom was completely impossible with the pull side extended, ascender attached, and my full weight and thigh muscles applied. The rope didn’t budge a fraction. So I ascended the 90′ waterfall with a bum knee and ankle. By the time I got below the chockstone I experienced cramps in my legs and arms, had run out of energy quicker due to the cold water (no wetsuit, just rain jacket and pants) and was a bit fearful of the rope being cut. I knew it was jammed tight in the crack west of the chockstone, and as I got closer saw that the rocks jamming the rope were not smooth. Since the chockstone was above my head, it prevented a direct ascent up and over, and when I initially pulled the rope out from the crack (angling more horizontally) the rope and rocks creaked in the crack and reminded me of my 240 pounds and that tensioned lines are easily cut. I could not assess the sharpness of the rocks back in the crack and worried that I might be sawing myself. After trying a few different things with ascenders and footloops, I sucked it up and climbed past the chockstone using footholds on the wall, which I should have done from the beginning. At the top I found the rap rope buried in a rocky crack underneath a piece of wood the same diameter as the rope. The rope had pushed into the wood and past it to be buried 1/2″ below the surface for a length of about 4-5″ as well as jammed in the crack. No amount of flipping from below could have possibly freed it. I was a little cramped in arms and legs, pretty much depleted, and chilled and struck by bouts of uncontrolled shivering. I let the bottom know I was taking some time to rest and warmed up in the sun for about 5-10 minutes before moving the rap rope out of the crack, directing it over the chockstone, and heading back down.

My lessons learned:
Fatigue and chill inhibits good decisions. I was cramped and tired from ascending the wet 90′ and habituated to no footing at all for 80′ of a slippery wall as I arrived near the top. My thinking was muddled and I did not see the marginal but dry and workable surfaces right beside me at the chockstone.
Waterfalls can chill you quickly, even with just a trickle.",ICAD,"<p>Test pulls are valuable in situations where pulls appear to be difficult, but can require some coordination and discussion beforehand. An important consideration when descending canyons is having enough experience and equipment to descend the canyon safely and successfully in the event people are incapacitated or equipment is damaged/lost (eg. a contingency plan). Consider the level of experience in a group and evaluate if there are key members who are critical for the safe descent of the group; if there is only one person, or if you think to yourself, “if this one person gets hurt we’re going to be in trouble,” evaluate whether it is wise to descend a canyon in that scenario. </p><p>The same consideration should apply to equipment. If ropes are cut, lost, or become damaged; will a safe descent be feasible? In the event ropes get cut and are too short, they can be combined with knots such as European Death Knot (EDK), but passing a knot becomes necessary for at least one person. Others can potentially be lowered from the end of the rope, but this takes considerable time and can result in getting a rope stuck on the pull back up for the next rappellers, and may not always be safe depending on the conditions. Other advanced techniques can be used, but carry their own risks. Thus, tying two short ropes together isn’t preferable to having long ropes sufficient for each drop, and redundancy in ropes such that if ropes get damaged, stuck, or need to be cut, descent can still be made relatively safely and easily. </p><p>Extra ropes, or ropes longer than absolutely necessary are extra weight, but pay dividends when problems occur. If ropes do get stuck or need to be cut, always evaluate the risk vs the benefit of the decisions that follow. Remember, a rope is never worth someone’s life; if rope recovery is too risky or ill-advised, leave it for another team or another day. The more prepared canyon teams are for this kind of scenario, the easier this decision will be. </p>"

davis-creek-2016-06-24,Davis Creek,"I fell 40′ down a waterfall into the most dangerous hydraulic of Davis Canyon with a pack on my back and a bag clipped to my side. I’m writing this partly because I think it’ll be therapeutic but also because I hope people can learn something from it as well.

We went into Davis Canyon in the Pacific North West at extreme levels. This is a canyon I’d run 4 times prior (in high flow) gone first or last on all the dangerous sections, and was able to escape the potholes/hydraulics. There was at least 30-40% more water when we went in. The canyon has changed significantly since the last season – logs that were anchors had been flushed away, rappels are now jumps, logs used as footholds are buried 2 feet underneath the water, downclimbs became slides, and the swirling potholes weren’t just swirling, they were swirling and all white water. The last technical rappel is the most dangerous. It’s 80 feet and all the water lands in a hole about 3×4 wide (and very deep). Even in high flow, we normally rappel directly into the flow and land in the hydraulic and escape it. It’ll bob you up and down for a while…but with a couple good kicks and diving down, you can catch the current out. With the current flow, our group decided it would be safer to avoid this hydraulic. This required rappelling down some very slippery rock Down Canyon Right, crossing the waterfall, getting onto a ledge, traversing to a ledge, getting off rope and jumping 30 ft from the chaos. Once you start crossing the waterfall, you run the risk of penduluming. Two people had gone down before me. We needed to deploy the pull line so as to set up a guided rappel. The anchor is on a slippery slope Down Canyon Right and Luca had attached two rope bags to my side before I got on rappel. In order to get around him, I had to go below him and step over the rappel line (it was tensioned by the force of the water). As I started rappelling, I realized the lines were crossed and that some of the ropes had started to come out of the bag. I struggled to fix the issue as I was slipping on slippery rock, had problems pulling up the rope bags and moving them since they were getting pulled down by the water, and had problems lifting the rappel line since that too was getting pulled by the water. Luca saw the issue and told me to ascend back up. He thankfully made the call that I was too frazzled to deploy the two rope bags and instead gave me a bag to take down instead. With the bag clipped to my side and my own pack on me, I rappelled down a couple feet. I slipped, but no problem, I’ve done that before and got back up. Now I had to cross the slippery waterfall. Once you start crossing the waterfall, you are out of the fall line and risk penduluming. I could tell the pack on my side was getting pushed by the water and was throwing me off balance. When I crossed the waterfall, I slipped again. But this time, I was in the full force of the water, and I struggled and kicked to get back on my knees and feet. I should have locked off to free my hands to get myself upright, but I death gripped the rappel line with both hands below the descender. When I was back up on my feet, I was 2 feet away from a ledge; I took a step, and all I remember after that is that I was falling, being engulfed in water, having a tremendous amount of water pushing me down.

I hit a few things on the way down but before I knew it, I was deep inside a hydraulic and took a few good spins. I attempted to swim to the surface, but even with a few strides, I still wasn’t at the surface. I remember thinking “shit, I didn’t breathe before I landed.” I wanted to take a breath but still hadn’t broken the surface. I kept kicking and eventually made it to the surface. I remember feeling relieved but then immediately felt the pack at my side dragging me down. Immediately I knew I was not in a good situation but all I could think to do was to just keep my head above water so I could breathe. I tried swimming out but the pack kept pulling me back. The entire waterfall was also crashing down on my head. I just remember trying to swim out (more like flailing my arms) and suddenly I was getting pulled out.

Thor had thrown a rescue rope and though I had no clue that he had thrown it, I had somehow managed to grab it and Logan and Thor pulled me out. The first words out of my mouth (and I think I repeated it a few times) was: “I couldn’t get out, the pack kept pulling me down.” I luckily came out with a few bruises and a whole bunch of new things I’ve learned.",ICAD,"<ul><li>Minimal friction should be used to avoid inverting or entrapment.

The maximum friction your feet will provide is when you are perpendicular to the surface, with as much weight as possible in this vector.</li><li>Hydraulics can be very dangerous and in this unique case, flotation can be a danger rather than a help, as the key to escaping hydraulics is to get below the circulating current. Packs should be removed beforehand to ensure maximum swimming potential, and loose gear attached to the harness can get caught in cracks and trees in the water and should be secured as best as possible (eg. loose slings, open carabiners, etc).</li><li>In swift water, throw ropes can be life<li>saving safety devices. Ensure that the proper rope (floating) is used in the throw bag, that it is properly packed and ready for deployment, and that the thrower is trained and proficient in the use of throw ropes. Oftentimes, inexperienced rescuers throw the wrong (loose) end of the rescue rope, resulting in extremely poor effect. Swiftwater training courses will demonstrate how to properly throw rescue ropes, and additional training is highly recommended for those exploring more dangerous class C canyons.</li></ul>"
nobe-young-creek,Nobe Young Creek,"I was canyoneering in a little documented canyon in the eastern Sierra with two friends. We were wearing full wetsuits but there was very little water past the first rappel. I went ahead of the others to set the next rappel and sat down to slide a wet slab into a small pool of water. I had too much momentum and my left shoe hit bedrock on the other side of the pool, forcing the foot up toward the shin in extreme dorsiflexion. I thought hitting the water would slow me down more than it did.

There was a good deal of pain, but when I took my shoe off to examine the foot, there was no swelling or discoloration. I kept it in the cold water for a few minutes and wrapped it with self adhesive sports wrap, which provided great support. After the initial jolt, my foot was sore but I was able to complete the canyon and hike out two miles with minimal discomfort. Later that evening, it began to swell and throb. I had my foot x-rayed the next day and there was no damage to be seen, although I had sprained ligaments on both the inside and outside of my ankle. After several weeks with no improvement, I had a CT-scan, which revealed bone marrow edema and a bone bruise, which is similar to a fracture but with less damage to the bone. When my foot struck the rock, it moved in such a way that the end of the tibia knocked into the talus bone and crushed part of it.",Main,Toboggans often present hazards that cannot be assessed from above. The rock must be checked for irregularities where the person will slide. The landing zone needs to be investigated first by a person on rope to verify there are no hazards.
bear-creek-2016-08-13,Bear Creek Canyon,"A canyoneer was the first in her group to start down a rappel, but water flow pushed her so her finger was entrapped between her rope and the ledge, an overhang. With no footing or wall support, she was stuck directly in the water path and could not easily free her hand. She yanked her finger out from under the rope, feeling ""every bone break."" After rappelling a few feet further, her hair got stuck in her rappel device, and while she had an air pocket should could not easily access her rescue gear. She signaled for ""Emergency! Lower me!"" but the group above could not rig the pinched figure 8 to do so. With the help of a SAR teammate, the team was eventually able to convert to a haul system to lower her.",ICAD,"<p>Although rappelling may appear easy, it is a perishable skill that requires good judgement and forethought. Overhangs, lips, squeezes, and flowing water can make rappels especially complicated and difficult for less experienced rappelers. Thinner (and therefore faster) ropes can be startling toward the end of a long rappel. In general, hands should not be between the rope and the rock; a slip or loss of footing could cause entrapment of a hand or hair between the rope and rock, and could also cause the rappeler to let go of the rope. Overhangs are a common cause of this type of problem, and keeping the non-rappel hand off to the side and away from the rope and rock should be a conscious effort; it doesn’t hurt for the anchorman to give this reminder or other tips if conditions warrant it.<p></p>Those manning anchor stations should be cognizant of checking rappelers before they get on rope, and offer pertinent advice or information for the rappel as it is known, or as the first rappelers feeds information back to the anchorman. This communication is critical for enhancing safety, as the first rappeler should be more experienced, and therefore theoretically more capable, of identifying potential problems on the rappel for the rest of the team. Those manning anchor stations are also responsible for not only managing the anchor and rope, but also monitoring rappelers as they descend or overcome obstacles whenever possible, serving as a spotter. Thus, it is important to ensure that anchormen are not distracted with other tasks or unnecessary communication.Another important consideration with releasable anchors is the gap between theoretical and actual releasability. Releasable anchors should be, “reliably releasable and reachable.” Awkward anchor locations or poor placement/routing of the rope through a Figure 8, for example, can cause the rope or a Figure 8 to be pinched against the rock or anchor bolts when the system is loaded. Or, anchor locations can be difficult to reach or man safely such that manipulating the anchor can be difficult while ensuring team members can approach the anchor safely and get on rope. These considerations should be evaluated when placing bolts or anchors (as should the pull angle), bearing in mind that optimal anchor locations can vary with canyon conditions.<p></p>A test of releasability (and pullability) can be valuable and informative; the first rappeler can load the anchor, and the anchorman can evaluate the rappel angles, load distribution, and accessibility of the anchor to ensure that it will be releasable and reachable under load.<p></p>If a releasable system is not releasable under load during a test, slings can be used to extend the system away from the rock. Or, if the system is pinned, a cowstail can be used to clip to the figure 8, and body weight (from the anchorman or other team members) can be used to temporarily unjam the Figure 8 from the bolt or rock.<p></p>For rappelers, getting hair, gloves, pack straps, or gear stuck in a rappel device is always a risk; keep in mind that flowing water can move hair or other equipment out of “secure” locations and right into the rappel device. Buffs or bandanas can be useful tools for keeping hair out of the way, as hair ties and clips can get pulled off or break under the force of jumps or flowing water. Teammates should also be routinely checking each other to ensure that gear is managed properly and risks such as loose hair or straps are addressed; if anyone observes an unsafe condition, or a potentially unsafe condition, they are obligated to speak up and inform the rest of the team, as canyon descents are safest when everyone is looking out for everyone else.</p>"

Many canyoneers descended the 2-stage rappel without incident with a meat anchor backing up the anchor. A long break between the 4th and 5th rappelier led the meat anchor to remove himself from the backup for a break. When the 5th person was descending there was no backup. They rappelled the first part of the drop, but when the rope was re-tensioned at the second drop the webbing snapped and the rappelier fell about 10 - 15 feet and landed on his back in wet sand. He was buffered by his pack, though he still sustained several breaks to his hand arm, and ribs. With assistance he was able to be lowered down the remaining 13 drops of the canyon. There is an extensive discussion of the webbing, which was strength tested after the incident, here: http://ropewiki.com/Incidents:Webbing_failure_in_Cerberus",Main,"All natural anchors need to be thoroughly inspected.

heaps,Heaps Canyon,"I descended Heaps canyon with four friends. I have descended it twice before. I was the only one of the five of us who had done the canyon. My friends were all advanced canyoneers. Weather was clear. Over the years, I have had many discussions about the final corridor, up climb and final rappel sequence. I tend to run cold. So, for Imlay and Heaps I have always used a drysuit. I did so this time. My drysuit functioned perfectly in a swimming pool a few months ago. Not so this time. Once I was into the deep, dark, cold, wet section; I felt water entering at the level of the pee zip. I stopped, took off my harness and operated the zipper back and forth a few times. There was no obvious problem. However, I would discover the next morning that the end stop for the zipper had become separated from the drysuit. This resulted in a toothpick sized hole that let water in. The defect was not visible to me while I was wearing it.  It was worse when I swam. As the canyon progressed, I was getting increasingly wet and cold. In the sections that involved a lot of movement out of water, I felt fine. In the water, I was not. I mentioned twice to one of my friends that I was cold. A few minutes later the group asked me if I should stop and warm up. The location they chose on canyon left did not look inviting. Hence, we continued for a few minutes. They asked again. This time the location looked reasonable. I climbed up a short distance above the water and sat down. The next think I knew, I was sitting with a space blanket wrapped around me and an emergency candle between my legs. That felt great! My friends built a small fire and coaxed me to leave the candle. I slept for a while. Lovely hard rock mattress. I think there must be a mathematical equation that describes the longer a person lays on a rock, the harder it gets. Over the next few days I became aware of what had happened as my friends gave me bits and pieces of information. After I sat down, I became incoherent. They had to fight me to get my wet clothes off. They feared I might die of hypothermia. One of the individuals who stayed with me had experience with death, hence he and another got to share the hard rock bed. Two others finished the canyon and called for rescue.
 
As the sun came up, I closely examined my drysuit, discovering the problem. Duct tape would easily make an emergency repair. We considered finishing the canyon. However, we knew the rescue team had the GPS waypoint of our location. So we waited. After three flybys of the helicopter and a few hours of deliberation, two rescuers descended from the rim to our location. The plan was for all five of us to finish the canyon. They each brought 300 feet of 11 mm rope. Neither had done any canyoneering. Neither had ever been in Heaps before. Off we went. Eventually we got to the end of the final corridor. There was a blue webbing anchor tied around a log on canyon left. I backed it up while the other four descended 60-ish feet. Now they were looking down the 500 feet to Emerald Pools. Opps, I had misdirected them! However, they discovered that my two friends the day before had also gone this way. They had tied together 500 feet of rope and descended, leaving it attached to the anchor. While the two rescuers and my two friends were in the exit slot, I did the standard climb up the usual exit route. My apologies were clearly not enough. The four had to ascend back up. One of the rescuers would not allow my friends to untie our 500 feet of rope. We finished Heaps in the usual way using one shorter canyon rope plus the two 11 mm ropes.
 
Once the ropes were pulled and people were leaving the Emerald Pools, one rescuer took down my name, etc. He asked with hindsight did I think the rescue was needed. I gave a rather convoluted answer.  When I was hypothermic and incoherent, my friends decided that rescue was needed. But then I warmed up and discovered the cause of the leaky but fixable drysuit. At that point no rescue was needed. However, we had no way to communicate that until the rescuers arrived. But if the three of us would have exited the canyon without the rescuers on the usual route, we would have discovered there was no rope. At that point rescue would have been needed (or at least we would have needed 500 feet of rope). Perhaps we would have figured out that our two friends the day before had taken the other exit route.",Main,"<p>Drysuits can fail. As in this case, even being prepared with repair material may not be enough. The cause of the leak was not obvious. Consequently wearing a thin wetsuit inside the drysuit may mitigate the cold and prevent a disaster. Other thermal concerns such as extra warm, dry clothes and the ability to start a fire are important. Space blankets are a must.</p>
<p>The greatest concern is why I missed the usual exit up climb. I appreciate I had been hypothermic. That has some lingering effects physically and psychologically. I had little food or water for the previous 12 hours. I had little sleep. Most importantly there was the blue webbing around the log. It was like a huge magnet that pulled me to it. I developed tunnel vision on that anchor, ignoring what I knew about the canyon.</p>

fornocal-2017-06-17,Fornocal,"I was soloing on this trip in order to collect scientific data in the canyon (I am a river scientist, and I was studying the physical and biotic characteristics of canyons in Spain on this trip). While the rock in Fornocal is generally sticky, this drop had two unusually slick spots in it, one of which I slipped on. Successfully downclimbing the preceding drops and having already successfully descended and collected data in 14 canyons in the last two weeks (5 of those solo) likely made me overconfident as I descended this canyon, which may have contributed to my rushing and poor downclimbing technique. I also consider myself an experienced and capable canyoneer and field scientist. This injury was another reminder to check my ego at the first drop and more carefully consider my personal safety when planning field data collection. 

Fornocal is a long canyon, and despite getting an early start, I was moving fast to ensure I had time to collect the data I needed. As part of moving fast, I downclimbed this particular drop facing outwards, not maintaining 3 points of contact at all times during the downclimb. While I commonly downclimb facing outward on easier, low angle drops (e.g., where butt sliding is helpful), this was not an easy downclimb (steep, nearly vertical, with hard-to-see pockets and caves). While downclimbing a short (less than 5 meter) drop that ended in a shallow (less than 1.5 meter) pool, one foot slipped out from underneath me. Due to not having enough points of contact, I fell approximately 1.5 – 2 meters and landed chest-deep in the pool at the bottom of the drop. My right foot struck hard on a bulbous upward protrusion of travertine. I experienced sharp pain in my right ankle. I limped and swam out of the pool onto a dry ledge that separated this pool from the next drop (a short rappel).
 
I had just got my Wilderness First Responder (WFR) certification a month prior, and followed NOLS wilderness medicine protocol to treat the injury (sized up the scene; checked airway, breathing, circulation, disability decision, and exposed the injury; did a head to toe exam; and went through a full patient history). After a useability test, I found I had limited range of motion and my ankle was tender to movement, but not pressure. I taped my ankle to support it, but found that I didn’t have enough tape in my first aid kit to do a full tape job. (For context, this was day 17 of a 30 day trip in which I was doing 1-2 canyons per day with only occasional rest days, and I had already treated other minor injuries on the trip.).

I was able to continue down the rest of the canyon, slowly and get back to my car without further injury.",ICAD,"<p>Experience mitigates some risks, but adds other risks. Complacency can occur when we have sufficient experience such that we tend to “automate” or perform tasks without conscious thought because we have some level of subconscious competence. While this is normal behavior, because environments are constantly changing even though they may be similar to our historical experience, this instinct poses additional hazards. We must consciously put an effort into challenging our preconceived biases and experiences to properly and accurately assess situations we are in, “here and now.” Many accidents have occured because “we’ve done it that way before,” or, “we’ve done this a million times without a problem.” But risks are not black and white, and just because methods have worked many times does not mean they will always work in all situations; or, many times, we can make mistakes without consequence, and without conscious introspection, we may not realize that a mistake was made or that there is a safer and better method for approaching the problem, even if other methods will work… most of the time. The fact that no negative consequence occurred doesn’t necessarily mean the best or safest method was applied to the problem.</p><p>As always, canyoning solo presents significant risks, even in “easy” environments or with “experienced” canyoneers. Anyone can make a mistake or experience a bout of bad luck, and although we can mitigate many risks, we cannot eliminate them. Working in teams with experienced canyoneers not only brings in different and valuable perspectives to approaching problems, but also mitigates risks in the event of serious injuries or technically challenging problems. Many technical challenges or problems are easier to overcome with multiple people and more equipment as well, and the burden of carrying equipment can be distributed. Although many canyons have been descended solo without incident, some have perished or suffered serious injuries because they were adventuring alone, and would otherwise not have had the same experience if others had been there to assist.</p><p>Proper canyon pacing is also extremely important; extingent circumstances or serious problems can be compounded by more mistakes or injuries. Thus, when proceeding through a canyon, even or especially in, an emergency, due care and consideration must always be taken when resolving rappels, downclimbs, flowing water crossings, other technical challenges, and even stream walking. Rushing, fatigue, and deteriorated mental performance leads to mistakes, and mistakes can compound already serious issues. Techniques to move efficiently through a canyon are numerous and can expedite travel times, but regardless, teams should be prepared to spend the night in any canyon in the event of an unexpected problem.</p><p>Another consideration for canyon pacing is day to day and weekly/monthly pacing. Consecutive days of canyoning or other events or responsibilities that reduce sleep and require a high degree of physical and mental performance  add an element of physical and mental fatigue that carries forward over time. Although time constraints in unique environments and limited vacation time can tempt us to “make the most of the time we have,” make a conscious effort to constantly evaluate your mental and physical state, and those of your fellow companions. Mental or physical fatigue, coupled with a “fear of missing out,” can unnecessarily elevate risks of serious injury or catastrophic events over time. As fun as canyoning can be, there are other fun activities, great food, and interesting people to meet outside of canyons, and these rest days can make the next canyons more pleasant, enjoyable, and safer.</p>"

seven-teacups-2017-07-21,Seven Teacups,"Here we are, at the corkscrew. The plan was for me to go first so I can get shots of “C” rappelling in the flow. So I set the rope, threw it out, and quickly got on rappel. I stood hanging at the lip, taking in the feeling of water massaging my side. I laid down into the heart of the flow feeling the full brunt of the corkscrew on my body and was anticipating to soon be shot out from the waterfall. But wait… There’s a knot next to my brake hand. My head and body was being pounded on from the flow from a constriction. I’ve ascended quite a few waterfalls in the flow and this was the worst of them, flow wise. I moved to get my head out of the flow for better breathing by smearing against the wall. Lucky for me I’m on the down canyon right side of the flow, making it easier to maneuver my head into a less annoying spot. I tried playing with the knot, maybe it could come undone. Nope, I merely made it tighter as my hand slipped and the knot inched closer to my extended device. I can unload my device, I thought. No, that would be even more annoying while in the flow. Alright, I’ll just cut it. Extension or rope? Rope, it’ll be easier for “C” to fix should he choose to reset. Okay, I’m so glad my knife is easily accessible and I’ve grabbed it several times to know where it is. Yet, it wasn’t the easiest to grab. The majority of the water was pounding on my torso and legs now making tactile feeling pretty dull. I patted around my harness a few times hoping to just feel the knife handle protruding out like it usually does. I couldn’t feel the difference besides that there’s something hard there with all the tactile noise. My mind wandered to take a break from the stress. Maybe it’s my neoprene making it hard to feel? Wait, that doesn’t matter now, I just need to get to that knife. I patted my harness again but this time tracing it from the waist until I found a shape that made me happy. I fingered a familiar hole and pulled my knife out easily.

I took a deep breath and brought my knife to above my brake hand in what felt like slow motion. My mind was still racing: Man, this would suck if I had my knife on a carabiner hanging on my gear loop. Even more if I had to open it up. I fell into the pool below with a glimpse of the calm behind the waterfall curtain flashing before me. Not wanting to lose either I held on to my knife and the new cut rope. Dark green water filled my view as I was pushed under the falls and I took my first easy breath.",Main,Contingency rigging and pre-coordinated whistle commands can quickly resolve a situation like this. Care must be taken when deploying a rope into moving water.

salmon-river-gorge-2017-08-05,Salmon River Gorge,"According to Jerry King's Facebook account: ""We had an epic rescue Saturday night and into Sunday! 22 hours! A young man who was canyoneering in the upper Salmon River gorge leapt into the river at Frustration Falls and suffered a compound fracture of his ankle. He was at the bottom of one of Clackamas County's deepest, steepest and most remote wilderness canyons! We got the call at 5PM and spent much of the night hiking in 4 miles and deploying 2700' of rope (roughly 200#). Once we reached him it was apparent that it would be better to have an Oregon National Guard helicopter drop a hoist and extract him. The first try was aborted because it was too dangerous and they returned to Salem, refueled, got another crew and better hoist mechanism and returned to pluck him off the river bottom at 11AM. Then began the work of gathering ropes and equipment, climbing out of the canyon and hiking 4 miles back to the road.""",Main,Pools should always be checked by someone who enters first via rappelling or other controlled means to ensure there are no hidden hazards and the depth is sufficient.
seven-teacups-2017-08-10,Seven Teacups,"As reported on ropewiki by two persons on the trip:

Last Person At Risk: “This trip to Seven Teacups was a first time class C experience for one of the 6 party members. I was manning the Corkscrew rappel anchor on a short tether to the top bolt. I had each member swim to me positioned as to not get sucked over the waterfall, I attached a tether, made sure each got rigged for rappel properly and lock off (or high friction setting), brake hand rope around back and down at legs (everyone is right handed), I removed the tether, each swung around and rappelled. This work[ed] fine for everyone getting onto rappel without having issues getting disconnected from the station in the moderate-high water flow once over the waterfall lip. All members did fine rappelling except one, who spent an awful long time on this short rappel. I monitored the rope tension, and kept feeling it release significantly in spurts as the member made rappel progress. I was ready to release the contingency figure 8 block if I detected that progress had stopped. I did not want to lower him unless necessary because this would add extra rope in the pool and thus the swimming disconnect could become much harder with a tangled mess of extra rope. As the rope was set, there was only a few extra feet, which we should have reset to zero, but no one that went down signaled to me to raise the rope slightly. I had another member at the bottom watching each rappeler (spotter) and he could arm signal me if he saw an issue with the rappeler, since I could not see anything from the top. I raised my arms in question once, and he signaled OK, although I could tell my spotter was intently watching the situation. I don’t think this took much more than a minute, but it was concerning nevertheless.

The member made the pool, disconnected, swam across teacup #4 and climbed up onto the rock slab with everyone else. I was the last person at risk. I tossed the pull side way out with a float. Another person grabbed it. I rapped without issue and climbed out on the slab where all 6 were taking a short break. All seemed to be good. But all was not OK, as the member that had taken so long to rappel was freaked out from being “in over his head” as his first class C experience. Even being a solid class B canyoneer did not prepare him for the water pounding, issues breathing in the waterfall, wet swimming disconnect in an aerated pool, the cold water, and difficult climb out of the pool. He was simply “shut down”, had “greatly exceeded his comfort zone”, and was not talking. When we finished the break and we started moving again he just sat there. Once moving he was excessively hesitant to even move down the dry rock slab. I was already all the way down at teacup #6, since it’s just walking and sliding down to that point (no rope work). I watched as others helped him verbally down the slab and there was extensive discussion once down to the escape exit. The decision was made without my involvement (since I was physically too far away, but watching) that he and his girlfriend would exit the canyon via the easy escape route. The remaining 4 decided that we would continue the Seven Teacups descent, and we had no further issues.

There was also some indication after all members were back to civilization, that he may have had the brake hand side rope tangled in his backpack, and this would have caused slow progress on rappel. I could not confirm this, but this does bring up an issue. In strong waterfall force, it is often easier and safer to toss most or all the packs down drops after 2 or 3 members are in the pool below to retrieve them. I did not think about suggesting this for this drop, even though this is how we did this on my only previous trip to Seven Teacups. If in fact he did have rope backpack entanglement, that would explain much about his slow rappel progress. Tossing packs down would have solved that problem. Also for those new to class C waterfalls, removing the backpack from the equation is extremely helpful.”

Trip organizer/ subject’s girlfriend: “I think the biggest thing I will take away from this is to make sure the group knows how to communicate. Our party had no clear leader — I organized the trip, the last person at risk had more swiftwater experience, and “Canyoneer J” had run Teacups most recently. However I don’t think any of us truly embodied a leader. I had printed and distributed paper beta in ziplock bags to all members (contrary to what was stated in the original post) but wasn’t actively referring to it during the trip, as others seemed to have “taken charge.” Canyoneer J was giving advice on where we could jump/where anchors were.

However at no point did any of us gather the group and make sure we were clear on signals, or make sure everyone understood what unique challenges we’d face. (Rather, this was inconsistent; info was communicated really well on the first jump, but not so much on the corkscrew rap).

I don’t think anyone is to blame for this — we were a ragtag group assembled from the internet. I don’t think there was anything fundamentally wrong with the beta. I don’t think any individual failed in a responsibility. I don’t even think anyone was “in over their head” in terms of skill level. (Some of us were new to class C, sure, but what caused the incident had little to do with skill. And could have been much more quickly remedied with better communication.)

What I’ve learned from this is that even if I’m not the most technically experienced, I can and should still step into a leadership role and ensure that we all understand each other and know how to work together to solve problems. And if I don’t know the other people in my group well, I should make doubly sure I’m educating myself by reading beta and practicing techniques before I leave.

Having talked to my boyfriend a lot about this, what I can piece together is he got stuck and was unable to continue lowering himself, right on the part of the rap where the water flow is the strongest. This may have been caused by a rope caught between his back and his pack, but it’s unclear. I saw it there as he was getting on rap and tried to get my boyfriend & the last person at risk’s attention but didn’t; I didn’t realize this was such a tough rap and figured my boyfriend could easily correct once on rap. My fault for not reading the beta and not making a bigger deal of what I saw. Getting stuck caused [the rappelier] to get flipped forward, and with the pressure of the water, it was almost physically impossible for him to right himself which possibly made things worse by having shoes that were not gripping the wet rock at all. He waved to those already down to try to signal his distress, but they either didn’t see or didn’t understand what he was trying to say. I was still at the top and could not see anything.”",ICAD,"<p>Good communication is important; groups should establish common signals and communications at the beginning of the trip and the canyon. Proper contingency planning and awareness of skill levels and team dynamics are an important consideration before any trip, as are other traditional factors such as weather, conditions, etc. Individual skill level can be difficult to determine. Even if a person is “experienced” with Class C canyons, important questions can be asked to help determine whether a group will have good dynamics. For example, the roles people played during their canyon trips (trip leader, assistant, rigger, bagger, safety, belayer, pack mule, etc), whether they have been in emergency situations in canyons, who they have canyoned with (those people can serve as references), and technical questions or hypothetical problems can help elucidate an individuals’ level of experience.</p><p>Experienced canyoneers may not necessarily have good group and team dynamics, and can make situations more difficult by going ahead of everyone, not looking out for other team members, or having a cavalier attitude because of their experience. Due caution and contingency planning should always be done, even if the team is highly experienced.</p><p>At difficult or dangerous rappels, removing packs is incredibly helpful. In addition, those experienced with the canyon and/or the rigger for that drop should be constantly communicating information and monitoring the situation, from both rappelers and the team members behind. It is advisable to inform each rappeler about the hazards of approaching the anchor, the hazards of the rappel, and how to behave in the event of an emergency.</p>"
big-cottonwood-canyon-2017-08-21,"Big Cottonwood Canyon, Salt Lake City","Three canyoneers were at Ledgemere Picnic area, a crag in Salt Lake City often used for canyoneering practice sessions. They were practicing a guided rappel for an upcoming canyoneering assessment. After setting the top anchor, one participant rappelled down and the other two walked down. The three met at the bottom and discussed anchor options: a “bomber rock” they’d heard about but none could identify, a 3 foot tall dead tree trunk, and a huge rock laying on top of another rock at the river edge, creating a pinch point. Two of the participants had seen this last anchor successfully used at previous practice sessions and so the group settled on using that anchor. Doubled webbing was placed around the rock at a large pinch point, rigged with a Totem using plaquette mode, and the guideline was tightened. One of the participants then went up to descend the guided rappel. At the halfway point on the guided rappel the bottom anchor failed: the rock on top moved upward and out of place, causing the webbing, which was still intact, to come completely out and the rappeler to fall approximately 10 feet onto her back. She was able to walk after about 15 minutes and was driven to the hospital by one of the other participants. Her injuries included a fractured pelvis in 3 areas and a 50% compression in her L2 vertebrae. She spent a night in the hospital and was recommended to not work for a month and not canyoneer for 6-9 months.",Main,"<ul><li>The load on the guideline in a guided rappel is significantly higher than the load on the rappel line. The top and bottom guideline anchors must be very strong. The force on the anchors is greatest when the rappeler is at the mid-point of the guideline.</li><li>Pinch point anchors may not be strong enough for a regular rappel, let alone a guided rappel. They must be thoroughly inspected and tested. Preferably they will be backed up for all but the last person on rappel. Pinch point anchors are generally last-resort.</li></ul>"
wallace-river-2017-08-21,Wallace River,"We had 5 people in our group. Three of us were very experienced. Three of us had done this canyon about 10 days prior. It was a beautiful sunny day. The day of the eclipse in fact. The person who fell, Nichole, had done one previous canyon and this was the 9th rappell of the day for Wallace River Canyon which was her second canyon. We bottom-belayed her for the first few rappells. After that, she communicated that she was solid, comfortable, and no longer needed to be belayed. We were now rappelling down a 300 foot waterfall that was broken up into three separate rappells with established anchors at the different stations. The experienced canyoneers sandwiched her between all of us for safety but there was really very little worry as her skills felt solid.
The accident occurred on the second stage (~110’) of the waterfall rappel. The first 40 feet or so Nichole used the wall in front of her to walk her feet down as she rappelled. The wall then dropped away and although we discussed and warned her that this would happen, she found herself in a free hanging rappel.
At that time, she lost her brake hand. It went over her head and she lost control of the rappel. She fell about 60 feet onto a ledge of boulders.
The person on the ground got to her immediately. The rest of us rapped down to her. We had Garmin inReach. Two of us are Trauma ICU nurses. We signaled for help using the SOS inReach. Nichole was badly injured and medically unstable.
Snohomish Search and Rescue was en route in less than 20 minutes; however, because of the logistics of the canyon, the narrow area we were in, etc. it ultimately took more than 4 hours to air lift her out of the canyon. The rescue involved about 75-100 ground and air rescue crew. Nichole spent time in the trauma ICU, the hospital, and about 3 months in a wheelchair. She has had additional surgeries but is walking and continues progressing towards the life that she had prior to the fall.",ICAD,"<p>Positional changes and movements tend to be inherently more dangerous than being static because system forces change and dynamics change when transitions occur. For instance, going over lips or edges, changing the angles of rappel mid rappel (to say, avoid an obstacle or deal with a problem), or moving from one rock in a stream to another changes how weights and forces are distributed on surfaces or anchors that hold us. Hands can get caught between rocks and ropes, or unexpected balance losses due to a moving rock or tensioned rope slipping off of an edge or obstacle can damage equipment and anchors, startle rappelers, and can lead to injuries.</p><p>Thus, “areas of transition” should be evaluated with a additional consideration, particularly when flowing water is involved (eg. going from no water flow to water flow, or areas where water flow dynamics change due to obstacles (eg. rooster tails, hydraulics, siphons, etc)). Overhangs and cracks for example, tend to be locations where rappel devices, hands, shoes, and ropes can get caught, or unlocked carabiners can pop open. Flowing water or heavy packs can cause inversions or loss of footing and control.</p><p>Anchor locations should be decided not just based on the strength of the anchor, but in a location that is easy and safe to initially access, easy to man, easy to pull from, easy to start a rappel on, and less likely to be damaged by fast moving water or flooding. Oftentimes, it is difficult or impossible to fulfill all of these criteria, so tradeoffs must be made and decisions to place anchors in a certain location must necessarily involve (and should consciously involve) a decision to increase risks in other categories.</p><p>Experience and comfort (part of mindset) play a big role in safety as well. Being “too experienced” and too comfortable can be just as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than being inexperienced and uncomfortable due to a lack of experience. It is important that regardless of the level of experience, we evaluate the situation with as fresh a pair of eyes as possible; many accidents or injuries occur “after we’ve done it before” or after “we’ve done it this way and have never had a problem.” We always need to be vigilant and cautious to be safe, and evaluate situations as they occur on that day at that time, even if we have significant prior experience.</p><p>Although one could say this incident happened partly because of inexperience or improper equipment, canyoneers need to be cognizant of the fact that this could happen to anyone, regardless of experience level. Canyoneering is an inherently dangerous activity, and no one is immune from making mistakes or having a problem; thus, safety measures and safety mindset should always be discussed and taken, contingencies should always be evaluated and prepared, and we should be prepared for the worst even though we hope and plan for the best. In this case, having the medical experience on hand and an Inreach may very well have been the difference between life and death.</p>"
wallace-river-2017-08-21,,,Main,We were rappelling into water and on a ledge so a bottom belay would have prevented the ultimate fall but probably not realistic in this situation. She was rappelling with an ATC so maybe a device with more resistance would have helped as well. An ATC was her rappel device that she was most comfortable with. More experience on free hanging rappelling would probably have better prepared her to control her descent. We have discussed this for hundreds of hours. If only…

englestead-hollow-2017-09-03,Englestead Hollow,"On the morning of September 3, 2017, a 38 year old New Hampshire man died while rappelling on the first 300 foot entry rappel of Englestead Hollow in Zion National Park. According to a doctor who was with another canyoneering team at a nearby rappel station, and who was the first to respond to the injured man, the victim had to adjust something and instead of using his free hand, he took his break hand off the line. Being first man down, there was no fireman belay to capture him as he started dropping. He was unable to regain control and fell the last 80 feet of the 300 foot rappel. He smashed into rocks multiple times on his way down and suffered leg, hip and back injuries. A Department of Public Safety helicopter, which happened to be in nearby Garfield County at the time, was dispatched to the scene after another medical helicopter was unable to land at the canyon because of trees in the area. The DPS team, a nurse from the other helicopter, and a National Parks search and rescue team were eventually able to reach the fallen man but he died at the scene of internal bleeding. The victim was rappelling with an ATC on a brand new 8.3 mm Canyon Fire rope.

It is unknown how experienced he was in canyoneering.",Main,"p>A 300 foot rappel is not something to take casually. Everyone must be aware of and appreciate the importance of friction and how it acts upon a weighted rope on a long rappel. It’s not uncommon to be overly confident at the beginning of a long rappel as the weight of the rope itself acts as a fireman’s belay and can slow the descent. But as the descent continues and the rappeler get closer to the ground (i.e. less rope under or “belaying” you), friction diminishes and speed increases. An inability to add friction on the fly, can quickly lead to a loss of control. It seems that a number of factors contributed to this individual’s death:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being an Easterner, it is likely this man was not an experienced canyoneer. A route with a 300 foot rappel right out of the gate was perhaps not a good choice.</li>
<li>Beginner canyoneers should not be the first down a long rappel. That person can then provide a bottom belay for the others.</li>
<li>The rope was a brand new 8.3 mm rope. This is a small diameter and often slick resulting in a fast rappel. This is all the more reason to have an experienced person descend first.</li>
<li>In this case, the rappel device was an ATC. That makes adding friction on the fly difficult, but not impossible. A better choice for this particular route might have been a canyon-specific device such as a Pirana, CRITR or a Sqwurel, all of which enable adding or subtracting friction mid-rappel.</li>
<li>Having the knowledge to apply friction by other methods may have resulted in a different outcome. Some possible options with a tube device such as an ATC are:
	<ul>
	<li>using TWO locking carabiners side by side with the ATC to double the friction</li>
	<li>using another locking carabiner placed on the leg loop to thread the brake-hand rope through and be used as a “re-direct” to increase friction</li>
	<li>using an auto-block as a back-up in the event of releasing the brake hand, although auto-blocks can create some of their own unique problems.</li>

fish-creek-zig-zag-2017-12-17,Zigzag Canyon,"Two canyoneers descended and got their rope stuck 200 feet from the bottom of a 500+ foot wall. 

One canyoneer reported: ""I was able to rescue climb up about 75' above Kristy but here I was free hanging as the rock caved inwards and my top ascender was blocked by 9"" of a ledge that I can't get over. I couldn't get any leverage with my feet to try and pop my ascender over the ledge. Now I'm stuck tied onto my ascenders hanging there 500' above the ground and I can't go any higher because of the ledge but I can't go down because well, ascenders don't allow you to! Now I panic. I've gotta transfer to the other rope and if I undo one wrong connection, I fall to my death. I looped the rope through my belay on my harness, lock tied it around my thigh, and tried to figure out how to get off of my ascenders. I couldn't get any slack on the rope because of my weight so I had to cut away the slings that connected me to them and leave them there and pray I didn't drop. Cut. My thigh lock held and I was good. I unwrapped the rope from my leg and rappelled. Now we're back to square one. Anchored in and can't get our ropes down. ""  

He cut the ropes leaving him two pieces of 60' each, hoping to tie them together and complete the wall. Unfortunately at the next anchor he dropped them. 

Without the equipment to descend, they were forced to remain on a ledge until they were able to flag down a car passing on the road below. The SAR rescued them by helicopter and with a team. They waited on a ledge while temperatures dropped to 35 - 40 degrees by 11 pm when rescuers were able to reach them.",Main,"<ul><li>Each canyon requires a different amount of rope. In general a team should carry the equivalent of three times the longest rappel. However if there is only one long rappel, three times its length is not needed. Rather, great care must be taken to protect the rappel side of the rope for the long rappel in order to be able to retrieve it.</li><li>Having a beacon or other device to reach help is important in areas without cell phone reception.</li><li>All canyoneers need to be able to ascend and descend rope using some type of rope grabs. The equipment to do so must be on their harness. Often times all that is needed is unweighting the rappel device to overcome a jammed rope.

deimos-canyon-2018-02-17,Deimos Canyon,"A group of canyoneers of various experience levels (2 advanced, 4 intermediate, 1 beginner) were descending the canyon. Geoff was of larger stature and new to canyoneering and rappelling. He had successfully completed the first 2 shorter rappels of the canyon. On rappel 3, two intermediate canyoneers rappelled first, then continued to move down canyon, unbeknownst to the rest of the party. Geoff was using an ATC-XP for his rappel device and showed apprehension about having adequate friction on this longer (95’) rappel.

The team discussed whether he should use a different rappel device, or use an extra-friction setup like a leg loop carabiner re-direct or z-rig. It was decided that it would be unwise for him to try to learn new techniques on this longer rappel. The plan was for him to use the ATC-XP with 2 carabiners, a method of increasing the friction with this type of device. He struggled on the rappel and 1/3 of the way down he called for a belay, but lost control and fell 60 feet to the ground before the person on the bottom could run back and give a belay. His fall was softened by hitting a small ledge partway down and landing on backpack. He sustained contusions, small lacerations, abrasions, and swelling to the legs, arms, stomach, and head. There were no major or obvious injury reported. He was able to complete the canyon with no additional medical attention required, but was assisted on downclimbs and significant use of fireman belay on rappel.


Discussion about group dynamics: there was 1 expert, 1 advanced, 4 intermediate, 1 beginner. The accident occurred with the beginner on Rappel #3-95′. Geoff was approximately late 30’s male of larger stature and new to rappelling. Geoff was not known to the trip leader and a ‘friend of an intermediate friend’ described as being an avid hiker/backpacker, new to canyoneering. A friend thought Deimos would be a suitable canyon for this person. Geoff was nervous when he started the rappel, and the top team attempted to walk him through it to calm his nerves, but rappeler was out of eyesight quickly. It is unknown whether the rappeler truly did not have adequate friction or if it was a symptom of a newbie not trusting the gear, but Geoff was seen and heard to be exerting significant effort to rappel. About 30′ down rappel, Geoff is heard by the top party asking for a fireman belay urgently, with labored breathing. Intermediate group member at the bottom of the rappel attempted to run back to give belay, but could not reach the rope in time and observed the rappeler fall down the rope, bouncing off a small ledge on the way down and landing on his back on his backpack. Rappeler had let go of the rope in exhaustion from effort, possible due to lack of friction or perceived lack of friction. Rappeler suffered abrasions and swelling from the impact on the rock, but otherwise okay.

salmander,Salamander Canyon (aka Hot Spring Canyon),"<p>Two experienced canyoneers, Joy Welling and Casey Petersen, set out to run the canyon. Three and a half hours and 2.5 miles into the canyon, they reached Tanriverdi falls, 160’ waterfall. A 200’ Imlay Canyon Fire rope was rigged to the anchor with a figure 8 block. As Joy got on rappel, Casey said that he</p>

She was on rappel for at least a minute or 2. At which point, I heard a clink and looked over and saw the rest of her rope go over the edge and heard her hit. My guess was that while shifting on the face of the falls, the 8 may have been caught on part of the rock, somehow releasing the 8. I have used this block technique and never seen it fail. I yelled for her, no response. I looked over the edge and could not see her. I checked to see if I had service, although it was slight I was able to call 911 knowing I would not have any service at the bottom of the falls. I spoke with dispatch and was able to quickly describe my position in relative to the mountain range and my coordinates, then lost signal. I went back to the ledge where I was able to clip into the webbing and lean over as far as I could where I saw her lying in the pool face down, unresponsive, no movement.</q>

ding-dang-2018-03-21,Ding & Dang,"According to the article in Backpacker.com:

“The last of the light drained from the narrow gash of sky above me. I heard my cries for help bounce away through the canyon walls, but they received no answer. I was stuck, my leg was throbbing, and the temperature was dropping fast.

When I’d started the loop connecting central Utah’s Ding and Dang Canyons in the clear sunshine five hours earlier, I expected to be on my way home by nightfall. I’m the manager of a small movie theatre in Nephi, Utah, and I don’t often have weekends off, which makes finding canyoneering partners tricky. But I didn’t mind—ever since I’d bought a car a year earlier, I’d been exploring every hiking trail I could find within a day’s drive of home. I was used to going alone as I expanded my hiking résumé, building my skill level slowly to account for my solo status. I’d done Little Wild Horse Canyon and Bell Canyon, two beginner-friendly slots, the week before, and they’d gone smoothly. I was ready for a little challenge, and I set off that morning to explore the sinuous, rose-gold passages of Happy Canyon, which seemed like a doable next step up. But when the rutted dirt road proved too rough for my sedan, I had to turn to my plan B (worried about the drive in, I’d made one before leaving home). The 5.7-mile loop connecting Ding and Dang Canyons was nearby, and according to the trip reports I’d read, it was supposed to be pretty easy. But as I was about to learn, “easy” is relative. There was only one other car at the trailhead when I pulled in. I called to tell my mom about the change of itinerary and started hiking under blue skies.

I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt. There was nothing but sun in the forecast, but I packed a hoodie, plenty of food and water, and a handline in case things got trickier than expected. It was 2:30 p.m.—I had more than enough daylight for what I estimated would be a three-hour hike. I had the route all to myself. After a mile, it dove into Ding Canyon, weaving through V-shaped narrows and pocketed sandstone. I crawled over potholes and stemmed through notches, and by the time I reached the open ridge dividing the two canyons, it was 4:30 and I was tired. Still, I was halfway through the loop and only a bit behind schedule, so I headed into Dang Canyon. I reached the first drop in less than a mile. Wasn’t expecting that, I thought as I picked my way down the smooth, 10-foot ramp. The walls closed in the farther I hiked, and before long they rose several hundred feet above my head. I turned a corner and found myself at the edge of another drop, this time 16 feet. I spotted a rappelling anchor bolted into the rock, threaded my rope through, and used the handline to lower myself down the dryfall. I’d been craving a challenge, and this one still felt well within my ability. 

Only a couple miles left to go. I wound through passageways barely wider than my wingspan, but it was already 6 p.m. I needed to pick up the pace. Just then, the trail fell away in front of me. The drop was only 12 feet, but this time steeper than before. I scanned the rock for an anchor. Nothing. At the bottom, footprints led away through the sand, vanishing down the other end of the canyon, so I knew it was possible. Other hikers must have downclimbed. I just couldn’t figure out how. I tried to hammer one of my Powerade bottles into a crack to create a chockstone to hold my rope, but it didn’t feel secure enough. And after feeling around for cracks and dimples in the rock, I decided I wasn’t comfortable with downclimbing.

Still, I couldn’t turn around. The last 16-footer would be impossible to climb—at least for me. Here, the canyon walls were too sheer to ascend and too wide to chimney. I had no cell service—and no options. It was 7 p.m., and I needed to do something. There were a few footholds about 4 feet down from the lip. If I could work my way to that stance, the drop to the bottom would be about 8 feet—not insignificant, but better. I figured I had a pretty good chance of making it without getting hurt—I just needed to amp myself up. I tossed my pack down to free myself up for easier climbing. No going back now. I climbed down to the stance and wavered there for a second, heart pounding. And then I pulled myself together, gritted my teeth, and jumped.

I heard the snap before I felt it. My left leg buckled beneath me as I fell to the ground and let out a string of curses. I couldn’t see the break (I’d fractured my fibula, I later learned), but I felt the dull pain through my adrenaline like a toothache through Novocaine. I stopped a moment to breathe, then wobbled to stand. I could still walk. With that drop behind me, I was one step closer to the end of the trail. I limped along for a few minutes before I reached the next obstacle—a wide, wedge-shaped chockstone. I hoisted myself up between the walls of the slot, stemming with my hands and good leg to avoid weighting the broken bone. When I pulled over the stone I saw water—a long, dark pool snaking down the canyon. I splashed in, calf-deep, and staggered on. And then I was at the lip of another drop: a 12-footer with water at the bottom. I couldn’t gauge the depth, but I knew better than to push my luck twice; this time I was really stuck.

I yelled for help but it didn’t take long to realize I was alone in the canyon. So I sat down and leaned back against the stone wall, switched my useless phone to battery-saving mode, and put in my headphones to drown out my thoughts. As darkness gathered and temps sank near freezing, my wet feet grew numb, so I peeled off my socks and shoes and put my feet in my backpack.

My parents were expecting me by 10:30 p.m., and they knew where I’d gone. Even if they didn’t call soon, I was sure other hikers would come through the next day—it was a popular hike. Someone would find me. It was just a question of when. As I’d prepared to leap off that drop, I’d accepted that I might be in over my head. Now, I tried to be patient, at peace with the fact that I’d made a mistake; beating myself up wouldn’t change the outcome. I burrowed deeper into my hoodie, but soon I was shaking with cold. I knew my family would be anxious—my mom, worried about flash floods, had told me to avoid slot canyons. Around 11 p.m., I pictured her pacing the house. I tried not to think about it.

Around 4:30 a.m. I heard voices and yelled. A man stemmed over the frigid water, moving toward me—the local rescue team had arrived. I could barely feel my face, but I grinned with relief as more rangers and volunteers showed up. As they loaded me onto a backboard and passed me hand-over-hand above the pool, I noticed it was beginning to snow.  

Key Skills: Stay Safe in the Slots

-Do your research.

-Check the weather (change plans if there’s any rain forecast over the canyon’s drainage) and read multiple trip reports before you go.

-Nathan Martinez, Goblin Valley State Park assistant manager and the first on the scene of Holladay’s rescue, recommends perusing online forums like candition.com for recent conditions reports.

-Leave a note. Cell service is scarce in canyons. Devices that use satellites can be better, but the safest option is to leave your itinerary with a reliable friend.

-Pack the essentials. Bring a handline (50 feet of 7mm cordelette or 1-inch tubular webbing) for short drops (check local LNT ethics before leaving lines behind). Wear grippy shoes, and pack layers in a drybag.

-Get unstuck. Need to climb slickrock? If you can, buddy up: A partner assist—like a leg-up or an extra hand—can often provide a sufficient boost, Martinez says. Not enough? Tie a heavy pack (or several) to a cord and throw it up over the lip of the drop. The weight and friction can provide enough counterforce to let you haul yourself up the rope.”

According to the news article:

“An injured man from Nephi was pulled out of Ding and Dang canyons by an Emery County Search and Rescue crew early Wednesday morning and helicoptered to a waiting ambulance at Goblin Valley State Park. Brigham Holladay, 26, had spent most of Tuesday stranded in the canyon after he broke his leg in a fall at approximately 7:30pm. He had come to a drop and jumped it, breaking his fibula in the fall. Holladay’s father called 911 at about midnight and told dispatchers he had last heard from his son at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. Sheriff’s office deputies found Holladay’s car at the trailhead for Ding and Dang Canyons about 2 a.m. and started searching the area, moving up each canyon. A crew found Holladay about two miles from the trailhead. Rescue officials put Holladay in a rescue basket and carried him down the canyon to an area where a helicopter could lower a cable 160 feet into the canyon and hoist Holladay out. ‘Not only did rescue personnel respond during the middle of the night, but they also waded through very cold water in the slot canyon, which was chest deep at times,’ Emery County Sheriff Greg Funk said. ‘The skills of the helicopter crew were incredible as they hovered in a very tight section of the canyon to hoist the injured man out.’ Emery County Search and Rescue, Green River Ambulance and a Utah Department of Public Safety helicopter also helped with the search. ‘I’m very grateful for them and I was very impressed with their performance,’ Holladay said. ‘I thought they were great.’”",ICAD,"<ul><li>Solo canyoneering involves significant added risk.</li><li>Injuries as a result of jumping are very common in canyoneering, mostly occurring in aquatic canyons.

zoicu,Zoicu Canyon,"Posted on triblive.com:   “Five people from France, including a seven-year-old girl, have died in a canyoning accident on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica after a violent storm created a huge wave that washed over them, officials said Thursday.

Prosecutor Eric Bouillard said the guide, who also perished, had been advised not to go on by two other guides who turned back as a violent storm approached. A preliminary investigation into the accident has been opened.

The body of the fifth victim, a young woman, was found a day after Wednesday’s accident, which was one of the worst canyoning accidents in France in recent years.

The group was moving through the Zoicu canyon near Soccia, which is known for its emerald waters, when the storm blew in. The canyon is popular with tourists and at least five different groups were beginning a descent about the same time.

The group hit by the tragedy originally consisted of 13 people including the guide, but some survivors turned back out of concerns about the weather, including the mother of the child, who remained with her father, the prosecutor said.

‘The weather was bad when the group started,’ the prosecutor told a news conference, televised by BFM-TV. ‘There was a risk of storms, but it’s up to the professionals to measure the danger …. The guide was advised.’

Bit by bit, people abandoned the group, especially before the second, more difficult, part of the trip, he said. Seven remained when the sky opened up and a torrent raged. Two from that group were saved.”",,
egypt-1-2018-10-19,Egypt 1,"Normally a good beginner canyon in Escalante, Egypt 1 received over a years worth of rain the prior week, making it not only treacherous, but advanced. Thick mud coated everything and made even walking difficult, let alone climbing and stemming.
At the third 15 ft rappel, the deadman anchor that is normally there and maintained by a local guide was completely missing. The subject of this report was a lone canyoneer. He suffered a compound fracture to the leg somewhere “after the third rap” according to his wife. She had heard his yelling below from the rim, after he had activated his inReach device.
Assisted by a group of canyoneers who had exited the canyon before the incident, the Garfield County rescue team retrieved the subject using a five to one haul. He was helicoptered to a hospital in Page, Arizona.",ICAD,"<p>Canyon environments can change even within the course of a day; due to various risks associated with canyoning, even under “easy” conditions, it is safer to canyon in groups of 4 at a minimum; this ensures that even if someone were to get hurt, one person could stay with the injured person while two others go for help, as it is safer to be in pairs and good teamwork could avoid an incident in the first place. Canyoneers should always be prepared to set up new anchors and have appropriate material to do so, as anchors can be washed away, degraded, or otherwise lose integrity. In desperate situations, even ropes can be cut to set up anchors in an emergency.</p><p>Good decision making and a mind to safety can help avoid serious incidents, but this decision making starts even before the canyon does; if conditions may be unsafe, or warning signs appear that indicate a higher level of danger than normal, caution is advised. Turning around, or doing the canyon another time, or with another group, is always an option before the first rope is pulled. If things do not appear right, or “gut feelings” cause hesitation, do not be afraid to ask for advice or for the team to stop and discuss your concerns; safety is everyone’s responsibility, and having the courage to speak up when you have doubts and having reliable partners to bounce ideas off of could avoid a major incident.</p>"

When in doubt, replace or rebuild the anchor. Always back up marginal anchors with meat (attached to rope/rapide, not webbing)."
bjelkes-mind-2019-02-01,Bjelkes Mind,"The incident occurred in a sandstone slot canyon in the Blue Mountains that is reasonably well known, but not particularly popular due to its remoteness. There are probably only a few dozen groups that visit it each year. It is popular enough to have fixed anchors (natural anchors with slings and maillons). The group that had this near miss were all experienced canyoners.

The first person in the group checked the anchor and rigged the rope. The rappel ring was a Maillon Rapide brand, zinc plated 6mm steel Delta (triangular) maillon with a rated Working Load Limit (WLL) of 250kg / Breaking Load of 1250kg when new. The nut on the maillon was not tight when checked, but was then tightly closed by hand. The maillon didn’t appear to be deformed. The first person descended without incident.

The next member of the party then descended. They also noticed nothing wrong with the maillon before setting off. They were not heavy and did not do anything unusual or shock load the anchor while descending. As shown in the photo below, the maillon failed catastrophically during this descent. Thankfully the rope remained attached to the anchor until the abseiler reached the ground; otherwise the person would have suffered a serious fall.",ICAD,"<p>Anchor failures intuitively pose a high risk of death or serious injury. In this case, the party acted appropriately to evaluate the anchor and integrity. However, keep in mind that a Working Load Limit of 250 kg when new is ~2.4 KN, and that the breaking strength of 1250 kg is ~12 KN when new/undamaged/uncorroded with a completely closed and secure gate. Although in theory this is a sufficient safety factor for one person, stainless steel/aluminum hardware with higher ratings are available for not much more cost in actual terms, considering that if the anchor hardware were to fail, consequences could be catastrophic.</p><p>Although systems will fail at their weakest point, and we cannot always control the weakest link/point in a system, when we can control and mitigate it, we should strongly consider it. Anchor hardware failures have been known to occur in places like Death Valley, where webbing looks brand new, but high UV exposure has caused inspected, seemingly good quality and good condition webbing, to fail unexpectedly even after rappelers of higher weight have gone first without issue. Thus, while inspection of anchors and anchor equipment is mandatory for safety at each use, it is not necessarily sufficient to prevent an accident due to anchor or equipment failure. In these cases, we can only mitigate risks. Thus, when possible, anchor hardware should be used over software (eg. stainless steel over fabrics or fibers), and higher rated equipment should be used when feasible (eg. 20-40 kN SS quicklinks vs 1250 lbs zinc plated quick links). And ultimately, we should be prepared for incidents like these should we do everything in our power to be safe, but just get unlucky. Emergency signalling equipment (eg. Inreach, Spot, Cell Phone, etc) and equipment to deal with extended and unexpected stays in canyons supporting an injured person, are therefore critical to have on hand, even on “simple” or “easy” canyons.</p>"
bjelkes-mind-2019-02-01,,,Main,"<p>Given that the maillon that failed was a recognised brand, a reasonable diametre, and being used well within its safe working load, this incident is particularly concerning. It highlights how easily a core component of an abseiling anchor can fail, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Some of the lessons I have taken from this incident include:</p><ol><li>Always check each anchor. Examine the full length of any tape / webbing to ensure it is satisfactory. Check maillons or other components to ensure they are in reasonable condition, are of an adequate diametre, and are appropriately rated. You are trusting your life to the anchor. Based on appropriate safety margins, I recommend only using 5mm or larger maillons.</li><li>Maillons, like carabiners, lose the majority of their strength if the gate is open. In the case of a maillon, ensure the gate is screwed firmly shut. Check the screw thread is undamaged (if the thread is worn, the gate will no longer work, resulting in a dramatic loss of strength). If there is any possibility that the maillon is damaged, remove it. Position the maillon in such a way that it screws downwards to close (so can’t work loose).</li><li>Not all maillons are made equal. Walk into any hardware store and you can find a range of quick links for sale. These are superficially indistinguishable. Most of these are not tested and rated to a level that makes them safe for use as an anchor. If the maillon does not include stamped ratings that indicate an appropriate strength, remove it. Also note that maillons can come in both stainless steel, and zinc-coated versions. Only use stainless steel maillons in moist canyon environments as corrosion can seriously reduce strength. The stainless steel versions are also much stronger than zinc coated maillons. For instance, the 6mm Delta Maillon Rapide in stainless steel has a WLL of 450kgs. The identical zinc coated steel version has a WLL of just 250kgs.</li><li>Consider using alternatives for fixed anchors, such as rappel rings. These rings are not only stronger than maillons because they don’t have a screw thread / gate that can corrode or be damaged, but they are also made of aluminium alloys, so don’t corrode. Additionally, unlike quick links there are not cheap hardware store knock-offs available, so they are easier to visually check.</li></ol>"
little-santa-anita-2019-02-10,Little Santa Anita,"Eddy was part of a group of 4 doing the canyon. He is an experienced canyoneer and enjoys practicing shallow-water jumping. Success in this involves adopting a supine-ish body position when hitting the surface of the water. While assessing a 6 foot drop into a 2.5 foot deep pool, Eddy decided it would be more interesting to slide into the pool, rather than jump. He went 6 foot or so upstream, sat down in the water flow, and started to slide. At the lip of the drop, his butt encountered a rough patch of granite, which slowed him abruptly and tipped him forward so that he hit the water feet first, instead instead of butt / back first.

Eddy’s footwear consisted of neoprene booties worn under Teva sandals. His left foot jammed hard between two rocks on the pool bottom. His feet were somewhat numb from the cold water, so the pain was blunted. He got up and found he could walk, and gave his pack to a buddy to lighten the load. Eddy continued the hike, still doing jumps, and completed the canyon. Back at the car, he peeled off the left booty; the pinky toe and its neighbor were bright purple and pointing the wrong way – toward the instep. The next morning, the two toes were very swollen but back in proper alignment. Crutches and cane were used for a few days; still limping after 2 weeks. Chiropractor exam results: a toe fracture may have occurred; taping and rest the only treatment needed.",Main,Eddy assumed that he would have better control over his body position. Canyoneers are reminded that jumps and slides must be scouted first.

falling-leaf-2019-03-30,Falling Leaf,"We were a group of three and needed to take an alternative exit from the canyon. The road to the beta drop in and exit were closed until April 1. It was a long, steep exit and we were taking as much care as possible to either stay close or stagger to avoid rock falls.
Around 7:40 and only 45 feet from the road, a large boulder around 2’ in diameter came crashing down the gully.

I tried to dive out of the way and the rock struck me with full force on my right side. The pain was excruciating and got steadily worse to the point where I couldn’t move an inch, even with the help of my teammates.

I activated my InReach, but I wasn’t sure if the message was going through. I kept receiving a message to move to an area with more open sky which I obviously couldn’t do. As a team, we were staying in one spot out of fear that more rocks would tumble down. At one point, a hiker came by and he later got cell service and called 911.

The rescue was very difficult due to the terrain. Three men were able to rappel down with a basket and hoist me up to the road. From there, I was airlifted to the hospital where a CT Scan revealed I had a broken pelvis.",Main,"It’s always dangerous to be in canyons and gullies, especially after a rain storm and Southern California had experienced several weeks of heavy rains.

lytle-creek-2019-05-27,Middle Fork Lytle Creek,"by Rob Largent:

I’d like to comment on the incredible skills and talents of the canyoning community. On Saturday, 2 March: after finishing Twister and eating half a lunch at the beginning of Rocky Creek, our group climbed down the hole and set up a camera to take photos through the canyon – and to just have a good time. While still near the beginning area, several people appeared as they were floating an injured woman on a lilo. A group separate to the injured woman’s group happened to have a lilo and donated it to be used as a floating stretcher in the water and as a not-so-floating stretcher over the rocks. Together they had hauled her up to the climb-down, climb-up hole at the start of Rocky Creek.

The woman had a shorty wetsuit, good footwear and a helmet. She was adequately dressed for a canyon. Additionally, she had an appropriately sized party. She had put her foot in a hole and fell over in a twisting manner with her jammed foot unable to move. This took out her knee and she was not able to use her leg for support or for movement. She was in intense pain.

While working out how to get her to the top of the hole I stated that I left my rope at the car and a member of yet another group said that he had 50 metres and a harness. We set up with a 2 to 1 mechanical advantage and then six people slowly pulled half a meter at a time while people at the top and bottom kept her aligned in the hole. Once at the top the lilo was used as a bed with a space blanket over her.

An advantage that we had over other groups is that we had a medical doctor with us. In a quick discussion it was clear that the best course of action was to use a PLB. We know that a PLB is a device of last resort and the decision to use it here was based upon a real need and a quiet consensus. With the decision being made, at 2:30pm the PLB was activated.

As other groups were emerging from their Rocky Creek excursions, one group was asked to call triple-o as soon as they had reception to alert or confirm that there was an injury at Rocky Creek, that a PLB had been deployed and to give some details. Half an hour later another exiting group was asked to call triple-o to double confirm the incident.

The helicopter arrived at about 4:30pm and started a grid search. Four people who had climbed to the highest points that they could get to were armed with colourful clothing as flags and were now violently waving these over their heads. On the ground near the injury four people took a second space blanket and holding it taut, used it as a mirror trying to show a bright spot in a dark canyon. Two paramedics were lowered down. When there were a few seconds to converse with a paramedic I asked if they were alerted by the PLB or by the triple-o calls. The answer was PLB.

Every group in the canyon helped or offered to help. There were people who did not know each other working beautifully together; loaning or even giving away gear. About half an hour after the paramedics arrived our group left heading back to the cars.

Sometimes accidents occur even when wearing all the right gear. Sometimes people just slip, trip, fall or take out a knee. I don’t know the people that I met on Saturday but there was an impressive amount of skill and talent displayed by them and I appreciate their desire to use it to help an injured person that they (and I) didn’t know. I really hope that the person who gave up his lilo gets it back.

I am hoping that this is seen as an expression of what happened from my point of view. In my own way it is also letting you know that your fellow canyoner is a person who has for years been refining their skillset. I saw it in action on Saturday.",,
seven-tea-cups-2020-01-15,Seven Teacups,"“I have been wanting to post my experience in Seven Teacups (7TC). Not only is this a great story, but I hope to learn more from the community and possibly help others learn from my mistakes. I thought I was going to drown in the middle of a waterfall. I made several errors, one of them being underestimating the force of swift water.

Last Summer, my family headed to California for a short vacation. I was excited to add a trip through 7TC since we would be in the general area. I researched the cfs flow in the Kern river to try and get an estimate of the conditions in 7TC. The flow in the Kern river was about 2400 cfs the day before the trip and one trip report talked about “low” flows being around 300-400 cfs. I figured that I was not measuring the right area/segment because the difference seemed too large. It turned out that the Kern was in fact raging and 7TC was in extreme condition. I took my then 12 yo son, Jack, with me on this adventure. We went into this adventure well equipped with the appropriate gear. I have been canyoneering for about 15 years and back in my 20’s was a pretty strong rock climber. 7TC was however our first class C canyon. Crossing the Kern to get to the top of 7TC was intimidating, but we made it. We bushwhacked up to the top of 7TC and suited up.

The first rappel is off an arch where you rig a retrievable anchor. The space under the arch was completely covered with water, plus about 4 more inches up. We rappelled down a couple of drops into the 3rd teacup. The drop into the 3rd teacup usually looks like a waterslide, but that day it was just a waterfall. While standing on a ledge in the corner of the 3rd teacup we were intimidated by how much water was pouring over. The anchor to next rap we could see on the other side of the teacup. The challenge was to swim in between the waterfall and the next pour-off. This next pour-off was a through a narrow constriction and I underestimated the force of the current. Oh yeah, I made the mistake of tying an overhand-on-a-bight into the end of the rope and clipping that onto my harness before I made the swim across so I could set up the next rappel. As I swam towards the anchor, I was filled with terror as the current swept me over the edge! I was stopped at the end of the rope about 30% of the way down the waterfall where the water flow begins to widen.


For the next minute I was drowning. I fought to push my head out of the flow of water, I could only get gasps of air. I prayed that I wouldn’t die leaving Jack trapped in the middle of this horrific situation. I remember thinking that he would likely be forced to spend the night there by himself, with his dad, dead on the end of the rope. From where Jack stood he couldn’t see me. My backpack (another mistake having it on) had been ripped off one shoulder and managed to pin my arm behind my back. The force of the water was immense. I was able to unclip the waist belt of the pack, sending the pack down the waterfall and freeing my arm. I was able to get my knees up against the wall and keep my head out of the water. I had a small pocketknife clipped on my harness and knew that was the only way I was getting out of this situation. My fear in cutting the rope was that it would leave us stranded in the middle of 7TC and I didn’t know if I would be able to get back up to where Jack was. I waited to cut the rope for now.

I struggled for the next 15 minutes fighting for my life to keep my head out of the water attempting to make progress upward. I did make it to an improved stance where I was out of the waterfall from my waist up. At that time I saw Jack appear on an elevated area in the teacup. He had swam over to where he could see what was going on with me. He told me later that he thought that I was dead. We were able to communicate with difficulty and I told him that I had to cut the rope. I told him to return to the corner where he came from, the safer corner, and wait. I watched him push off towards the other corner when the current swept him right past me over the waterfall. I turned and watched him swim to the edge where he was able to climb out of the water. Once I knew Jack was safe I cut the rope. We rested for 10 minutes in that spot overcoming the intense exhaustion.

Jack spotted my backpack circulating in a lower teacup. Then we watched it drop into the next teacup and drift to a quiet edge. We worked our way down and recovered the backpack. I did have an InReach Mini, phone, and other things that I was glad to get back. I did lose my camera which probably sits at the bottom of the teacup. Jack and I were able to hike around back to the top and get the rope. We made our way back across the mighty Kern and back to the Johnsondale bridge where my wife and daughter had been waiting for us for the past hour. I wept as I hugged my wife thinking about the foolish decisions that nearly cost me my life and threatened Jacks’.

 

I couldn’t sleep for 3 days following this incident. I sleep fine now but still think about how close I came to not being able to make it out of 7TC. 

 

I will do this canyon another day when the conditions are better. Please share any comments, advice or experience. Thank you for reading and thanks for sharing your stories, experiences and skills with the community.”",ICAD,"<p>Canyoning tends to be safer with groups of four, at a minimum, with a balanced level of experience appropriate for the canyon and conditions. Although some skills are related across disciplines, serious introspection and thought needs to be given before trips occur, in the planning stages. Although this report ultimately had a benign outcome, consideration should be given to likely contingencies or potential problems beforehand. If the author got injured or was otherwise incapacitated, Jack could have been left alone, stuck, without adequate equipment to even summon help. If a pack was lost, or a rope damaged, critical gear to descend the canyon safely could be lost without contingencies in place for these and other relatively foreseeable scenarios.<p></p>If the loss of a single piece of equipment would cause one to further risk life and limb on the uncertainty of its necessity in the future, we should reevaluate whether we were truly prepared and well-equipped. Single points of failure can be mitigated by having bigger groups with distributed and redundant equipment and skills. But the most important piece of equipment we can bring to any trip is the equipment between our ears. A good mindset and good decision-making trumps any material piece of equipment. Part of that includes the ability and skill to honestly evaluate your own condition and capability before and during a trip, and it also includes the ability to assess the overall group, scenario, and condition at hand. If there are any doubts about whether a course of action is wise, everyone must have the courage to speak up.<p></p>In the case of questions about beta or conditions, resources are available online via Facebook, Canyon Collective, Ropewiki, or other sites. Another point of consideration, though only briefly mentioned, is what some would consider to be the most dangerous part about 7 Teacups in high water; the Kern river crossing. Swift water is extremely dangerous, particularly in the case of canyoning, where being on the Kern river itself isn’t the primary objective; as canyoneers often don’t carry swift water specific gear (eg. PFDs, rescue throw ropes, inflatables), high caution is advised when crossing rivers or swift water obstacles. Dangerous approach or return conditions in swift water, which can change throughout the course of the day, may warrant cancelling the canyon trip.</p>"

upper-lulumahu-2020-05-10,Upper Lulumahu,"We were anchored to 2 trees, a dead (but solid) one and a very alive one. The third member of our group started to rappel, and as he went over the edge, he thought he saw the dead tree break. In his panic, he let go of his brake rope to try and grab the cliff, but began to freefall down the 80-ft waterfall with rocks below. One of the crew members on the ground jumped on the rope and performed a fireman’s belay, stopping the fall after maybe 15 feet. The tree hadn’t broken, but the webbing on it shifted and gave the impression that it was going to give out.",ICAD,"<p>Anchors should be inspected before each use, and monitored by the person manning a rappel at each drop. Slack in anchor systems can introduce shock loads, which greatly amplify forces on anchors; thus, anchors should be constructed in a way to facilitate a safe rappel (eg. anchor redundancy and strength, direction of rappel, safety of access in various conditions, ease of inspection, no slack in the system, etc) and ensure that the rope can be pulled while minimizing snag hazards on the pull.<p></p>Smooth rappelling technique, reduced angle starts from the anchor, and anchor backups can also be used to mitigate rappelling forces on marginal anchors. Anchors that are suspect should be replaced and/or backed up as appropriate. In the event of anchor failure, little can be done except to ensure the brake hand is tightened; slack introduced into systems (eg. ropes can get caught on objects and slip off later) can feel like an anchor failure, but there is no better option than to brake as much as possible; if the anchor hasn’t failed and instead the rope has slipped or slack has been introduced, a hard brake will keep the rappeler suspended and prevent a fall. If the anchor has failed, it will be nearly impossible to hang on to any object, as the weight of the falling anchor will eventually rip any objects attached to it (including the rappeler) down toward the ground.<p></p>Fireman’s belays can add some level of additional safety, but are not always applicable based on the canyon conditions. It also exposes the belayer to risk of falling objects, and the forces of a stopping a falling rappeler can dramatically move, shift, and injure belayers if they are not properly anchored or prepared for the shock load. Thus, it is not advisable for just anyone to perform belays (fireman or otherwise); belaying is a skill that requires training and practice to perform properly.<p></p>Accidents and mishaps can occur at any time; thus, it is prudent for any group canyoning to be prepared for worst, and be able to summon for help (Eg. SPOT or Inreach type devices), assist injured canyoneers (medical supplies, emergency blankets, trash bags, etc), and continue down canyon (spare equipment, ropes, experienced canyoneers) if necessary in the event of an emergency.</p>"
upper-lulumahu-2020-05-10,,,Main,"What went wrong in this situation was mainly the anchor and the way it was constructed. The way the webbing was tied (by a previous group), allowed it to extend about 6 inches, giving the impression that the anchor was failing to the man on rappel. I do not know what I would’ve done in that situation, as grabbing the cliff would make more sense that gripping the rope if the anchor had truly broken, but the fireman’s belay undoubtedly saved this persons life. Since that incident, we have employed a bottom belay at every possible rappel."
parkett-creek-2020-06-14,Parkett Creek,"Team of two canyoneers, experience level from Advanced/Intermediate to Expert. Both active mountain rescue technicians. Leader completed this canyon six times in the preceding year, partner completed this canyon three times in the same time frame. On this day water flow was very high, a6 in the French rating system. The team had received beta from another team of four experienced canyoneers who completed the canyon on the previous day.

Upon reaching the anchor station for R1 (~5 meter vertical plunge), both team members inspected the fixed anchor, a single loop of 1″ tubular webbing tied with a water knot around a 5″ diameter tree. The tree was smooth, lacking any bark, though it had a few broken branch stubs which were at least 6″ vertically above and below the webbing location. A standard 6mm maillon rapide was in place on the webbing. The webbing was identified as being the same sling placed by this same team of canyoneers on 16 June 2019, almost exactly one year prior. A minor nick in the edge of the webbing about 1″ from the knot was observed, but otherwise the webbing appeared in excellent condition. The knot appeared tight, and had tails approximately 2″ long on each side. The webbing was wet from heavy rain a few hours earlier, but showed no evidence of ever having been submerged by flood waters. It is estimated that at least 60 people have rappelled on this anchor since the webbing was placed one year ago.

A standard figure-8 block was constructed on the fixed sling and rapide. As the first canyoneer transitioned over the edge, he lost his footing and fell approximately 1 meter into the main force of the current. The second canyoneer, who was standing at the anchor prepared to to lower on the contingency anchor if needed, observed significant stretch in the webbing and the entire tree shaking from the force of the fall. The canyoneer on rappel struggled to regain footing, resulting in cyclical high loading of the anchor from the force of the water acting on the rappeller’s body. The canyoneer at the anchor observed cyclical stretching of the webbing that seemed abnormally severe. Suddenly the anchor catastrophically failed resulting in the rappeller falling approximately 1.5m into a pool of water below and was not injured. The canyoneer at the anchor was nearly struck in the face by the flying anchor hardwear. The second canyoneer grabbed the tail end of the rappel rope and pulled it entirely back up. The rope was undamaged and the figure-8 block was intact. He then constructed a new webbing anchor on the same tree (which did not appear damaged in any way) to descend.

The failed webbing and maillon rapide were located in the pool below. The rapide was undamaged, tightly closed. Both ends of the webbing appeared to be the original knife cuts. A loose overhand knot was present in one end of the webbing with approximately 3″ of tail.",ICAD,"<p>It appears that one end of the webbing slipped through the knot. The involved canyoneers hypothesize that the high force during the fall followed by severe cyclical loading under continued heavy force may have contributed. It is also possible the wetness of the soft webbing may have contributed.<p></p>It is also possible the mallion rapide may have been in contact with the knot, possibly contributing.</p>"
deimos-canyon-2021-1-30,Deimos Canyon,"This is my recollection of what happened that fateful day.

It was my once a year “escape from Utah” jaunt to warm, sunny Death Valley. The plan was originally to descend Cerberus Canyon. Since Dante’s View road was closed, Deimos Canyon became plan B. The group consisted of: Sarah Perlotto, Tim Seavy, Michael Cressman, Justin Ibershoff, Luke Galyan, Joshua Rodriguez and myself (Tracy Kwan). Most of us had been through Deimos canyon before; this being Cressman’s 10th time and Luke’s 6th time.

Got up to get ready for the day from camp at Slabby Acres at the ripe time of 4:30 AM in order to meet the rest of the group at the trailhead for 6:00 AM. After some sleepy greetings, we started up the steep hill littered with loose rock at 6:30 AM. The grueling approach went relatively quickly and smoothly, with Cressman and I in the front, Justin in the middle, and the others chatting it up in the back. We got to the head of the canyon about 3 hours later and started to carefully make our way down the chossy rock. We skipped rappel 1.

As we started to approach the giant boulder which marked the entrance way to the 3rd rappel, Justin made a comment about this specific rock being conglomerate, therefore we should be mindful of this while being around it being extra weary of its potential to break off. Cressman down climbed into the chamber left down canyon and I followed suit. Rappel 3 was anchored from a large rock. Cressman and I decided to change the anchor to a pinch point. Cressman wrapped some new webbing around the anchor and tugged on it to ensure that it was solid. I yelled up canyon towards Justin requesting that he throw the rope down in order to rig the 3rd rappel. He threw the rope down at my feet in the chamber (he could not physically see me) and proceeded to downclimb right down canyon through a crack. Within seconds of Justin’s feet hitting the false floor, rocks began to shift and move quick. Giant boulders followed as the rocks violently rolled over the edge of the 90 foot drop like waves on an ocean taking Justin down with them. It was loud and fierce. I felt rocks rolling out from underneath my feet as I was a only few feet away from the anchor and immediately retreated into a crouched position. Justin was a few feet away from where I was crouched. It was a horrifying moment. I looked up at Cressman wide eyed with shock, absolutely speechless. We did not have to communicate with words as our faces told the tale. The time was 10:35 AM.

“Is everyone okay?!” Luke yelled from above. “NO!” Cressman replied. Josh ran up canyon in order to push the SOS button on the In Reach. We had decided that it would be extremely dangerous to try to reverse the approach so the only way out was to descend the canyon. Sarah, who was trained as a Wilderness First Responder was sent down first in order to assess for injury. We rigged a rope up canyon on the left side in order to avoid the room with the false floor. Both Sarah and Luke checked Justin for vital signs but unfortunately could not locate a pulse or any signs of breath. Small rocks were showering them as they evaluated the situation presented to them. It was not safe until the whole group came down. The group rappelled down and assisted with rolling Justin over so that Sarah could perform CPR. It was blatantly obvious that Justin had endured immense blunt trauma. There were no signs of life coming from Justin. The sinking realization that Justin had passed away swept over us like a dark cloud. With the spontaneous rock fall still occurring, the group was still in imminent danger. We had to move quickly down canyon.

Communications with SAR had been initiated and they were gathering information. About an hour and a half later, we heard the Navy helicopter flying over us as we directed them up canyon. We spotted two individuals rappelling with a litter. With great caution, we descended the rest of the canyon as darkness enveloped us.

6:21 PM: Abby and her friend were waiting for us on the road as they happened to be in Charon canyon next door and heard the helicopter flying overhead. We spoke to another park ranger and proceeded to head to Abby’s house place as she had graciously allowed us all to stay there for the evening.

The next morning, we met the ranger heading the SAR team at the airstrip and they debriefed their recovery plan with us. We had wanted to make sure that they were not coming from the top in order to avoid the rock fall danger. They had already decided that they would not be coming in from the top. The rangers explained to us that the military helicopter from the day before did not recover the body due to the fact that when they determined that the individual was deceased, it was out of their jurisdiction, the helicopter was too large, they did not have enough man power and the equipment they had carried in was too heavy. On the afternoon of January 31st, SAR sent out a smaller helicopter with the equipment to do the recovery; which took about an hour from Badwater Basin.

Justin was a man of few words. Though I only met him once before, I would describe the aura he gave off as Zen. During one of the rest stops on the approach hike that day, I remember he had turned to me and said earnestly, “I love this view… “

My sincerest condolences to Justin’s family and friends.

May you Rest In Power Justin Ibershoff.

Addendum by Mike Cressman who was also on the trip:

What happened was a rockslide inside the room with the false floor, but it was not a result of the false floor. It was the bed of rocks that accumulates in there between the canyon walls. Yes, it is all on top of a false floor, but the floor is not what failed, and the same rockpile could exist regardless of the floor type.
That this particular type of failure would occur was not predicted. Because of the false floor, there was always this nightmarish fear of the chockstone floor structure possibly collapsing, but that is not at all what happened. The other concern has always been that one or a few of the rocks from the room would tumble towards the rappel and be a hazard to anyone on rappel or standing at the bottom of the rappel. That is also not what happened.
What happened was a rockslide of horrifying proportion, where a deep layer of rocks on the floor suddenly gave way and slid down the slope towards and over the brink of the rappel.
I also want to make it clear that there was nothing unusual or particularly hazardous looking about the locations where any of the three of us were actually standing. None of us were on a steep slope or standing at the edge of one. We were on a gradually sloping floor of rocks, the same kind of thing we stand on all the time in other places. And, importantly, not any different in appearance from the floor in that same room the other five times I have been in it.
What we didn’t expect, and had no reasonable way to expect, was that a failure that occurred several feet away, closer to the brink of the drop, would cause the entire mass behind it to slide.",Main,"<ul><li>I believe it had rained a few days before the accident in Death Valley.
